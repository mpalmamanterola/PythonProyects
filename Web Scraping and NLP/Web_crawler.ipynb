      "El Talibán anunció un nuevo gobierno en Kabul, 20 años después de que fuera expulsado del poder.\n",
      "Para una generación que creció con educación, inversión internacional y esperanza en un futuro democrático aquello debió sonar increíble.\n",
      "Pero ¿cómo cayó la administración anterior tan rápidamente? \n",
      "En solo 10 días los talibanes pasaron de tomar el control de una primera ciudad importante a llegar a las puertas de la capital de Afganistán.\n",
      "Se suponía que la capital sería diferente. La mayoría de los observadores creían que Kabul se mantendría hasta que se pudiera llegar a un acuerdo negociado. \n",
      "El domingo 15 de agosto todo cambió. En cuestión de horas, el presidente y sus principales funcionarios habían huido. \n",
      "Los miembros que quedaban del ejército afgano y las fuerzas policiales se quitaron los uniformes y se escondieron.\n",
      "El gobierno afgano apoyado por Occidente, respaldado por miles de millones de dólares en apoyo militar y entrenamiento durante dos décadas, simplemente se había esfumado.\n",
      "A través de entrevistas con personas que cuentan con información privilegiada y que estuvieron allí, la BBC reconstruye el relato de las frenéticas y caóticas últimas horas del gobierno de Afganistán.\n",
      "Sábado 14 de agosto\n",
      "El estado de animo del círculo íntimo de Ashraf Ghani, el presidente afgano, era de preocupación aunque no de miedo, le dijeron fuentes de alto nivel a la BBC. \n",
      "Se había elaborado un plan para asegurar la capital y se estaba discutiendo con el general Haibatullah Alizai, el jefe del Estado Mayor del ejército, y el almirante Peter Vasely, el principal oficial militar estadounidense en Afganistán. \n",
      "Un elemento central del plan eran las negociaciones para detener el avance de los talibanes que se encontraban ya a las puertas de la ciudad.\n",
      "Sami Sadat, un excomandante del ejército afgano en Helmand, la provincia más grande del país, fue reclutado para encabezar un nuevo equipo de seguridad de Kabul. \n",
      "El plan era luchar si era necesario, pero lo ideal sería tratar de asegurar un arreglo pacífico con los talibanes. \n",
      "Si eso no se pudiera lograr, entonces la administración de Kabul quería al menos ganar tiempo para las evacuaciones.\n",
      "Pero incluso cuando el teniente general Sadat se reunió con su equipo principal, los talibanes se estaban apoderando de la ciudad más grande del norte del país, Mazar-e-Sharif, y estaban comenzando a llegar a la urbe oriental de Jalalabad. \n",
      "Ambas caían sin apenas luchar. Kabul fue la última.\n",
      "Ashraf Ghani, un exacadémico y funcionario del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), había sido presidente de Afganistán desde septiembre de 2014. \n",
      "Los críticos dentro del gobierno afgano nos dijeron que había fallado sistemáticamente a la hora de evaluar con precisión la amenaza de los talibanes durante las últimas semanas de su avance.\n",
      "Pero sin duda lo primero que tenía en la mente era el destino del expresidente Mohammed Najibullah. \n",
      "De hecho, Ghani hizo referencia a este momento de la historia cuando más tarde explicó sus razones para huir.\n",
      "Najibullah fue capturado por el Talibán cuando el grupo se apoderó de Kabul en 1996. \n",
      "Los combatientes talibanes lo sacaron a rastras del complejo de la ONU donde se refugiaba y lo torturaron. \n",
      "Después de matarlo, colgaron su cuerpo de un semáforo frente al palacio presidencial.\n",
      "Domingo 15 de agosto, por la mañana\n",
      "A medida que amanecía y se multiplicaban los informes sobre los combatientes talibanes llegando a las puertas de la ciudad, la inquietud de los ciudadanos fue en aumento. Comenzaron a formarse colas en los bancos y el aeropuerto.\n",
      "Pero el círculo íntimo del presidente Ghani todavía creía que la caída ante el Talibán no era inminente.\n",
      "El personal del Arg, el imponente palacio presidencial del siglo XIX de Kabul, llegó a trabajar como de costumbre.\n",
      "La confianza se habría visto reforzada por un acuerdo negociado el día anterior por uno de los principales ayudantes del presidente, Salam Rahimi. \n",
      "Según una fuente cercana a Ghani, Rahimi había estado involucrado en comunicaciones por canal secundario con los talibanes, y había logrado acordar con el grupo que este se abstendría de tomar el control de la ciudad por la fuerza, a cambio de un poder interino compartido.\n",
      "Esto permitiría continuar en el aeropuerto la evacuación de extranjeros y de aquellos que estaban amenazados. \n",
      "También ganaría tiempo para las negociaciones que ya estaban en marcha en Qatar para formar un gobierno de unidad.\n",
      "En un esfuerzo por tranquilizar a los residentes de Kabul, el equipo de Ghani publicó un video el domingo en la página oficial de la presidencia en Facebook, en el que se le veía discutiendo sobre cómo proteger la ciudad con su ministro del Interior y otros funcionarios de seguridad. \n",
      "Lo mostraba sentado en un escritorio de madera ornamentado, hablando con su ministro por el altavoz del teléfono. \n",
      "El clip parecía sugerir que un acuerdo con los talibanes era inminente y que se evitaría cualquier enfrentamiento en Kabul.\n",
      "Pero parece que esto no fue suficiente para tranquilizar a los altos cargos.\n",
      "Fuentes de la BBC dicen que el presidente tenía problemas para comunicarse con otros miembros de su principal equipo. \n",
      "Su vicepresidente, Amrullah Saleh, ya había escapado al valle de Panjshir, a unas 48 km de Kabul, mientras que el ministro de Defensa, Bismillah Khan, no pudo ser localizado. \n",
      "El plan había comenzado a desmoronarse.\n",
      "Mientras tanto, una docena de políticos afganos de alto nivel se dirigía al aeropuerto para tomar un vuelo comercial a Islamabad. \n",
      "El grupo incluía al presidente de la Cámara del Pueblo (cámara baja del Parlamento), Mir Rahman Rahmani, y al exvicepresidente Karim Khalili.\n",
      "Un miembro de la delegación, Shakib Sharifi, funcionario del Ministerio de Agricultura, negaría más adelante que su viaje fue una evacuación.\n",
      "\"Nuestro objetivo era convencer al gobierno paquistaní de mediar y evitar el derramamiento de sangre en Afganistán\", dijo.\n",
      "Pero el presidente Ghani no quería que se fueran. \"Temía que negociaríamos un acuerdo con la ayuda de Pakistán que lo dejaría fuera del poder. Estaba totalmente en contra de que nos fuéramos\", indicó Sharifi.\n",
      "Los observadores han sugerido que el presidente, quizás ansioso por evitar provocar más pánico, permitió que el presidente de la Cámara del Pueblo abandonara el país.\n",
      "Sharifi describió haber presenciado una escena de pánico generalizado en la ciudad mientras él y los demás miembros de la delegación se dirigían al aeropuerto.\n",
      "\"Habíamos escuchado que el Talibán estaba en las puertas, pero no pensamos que fueran tan rápidos para entrar a la ciudad\", contó.\n",
      "\"La noche anterior estábamos extremadamente nerviosos y dormimos con nuestras armas al lado\".\n",
      "\"Había colas fuera de los bancos de gente que se apresuraba a sacar los dólares; había colas en el aeropuerto de gente que trataba de entrar; y mucho tráfico\".\n",
      "El tráfico era tan intenso que el exvicepresidente Khalili, que viajaba separado de los demás, tuvo que salir y caminar los últimos 15 minutos hasta el aeropuerto para llegar a tiempo.\n",
      "Una vez en el aeropuerto, el grupo recibía actualizaciones periódicas sobre los avances de los talibanes.\n",
      "\"Cada minuto recibimos informes de que los talibanes habían capturado lugares clave en la ciudad. Fue aterrador\".\n",
      "Dentro del aeropuerto, toda apariencia de orden se había colapsado.\n",
      "Un reportero de la BBC vio a gente luchando por comprar billetes para los últimos vuelos comerciales que quedaban. \n",
      "Algunos que ya habían asegurado un billete fueron bajados de la lista, ya que los parlamentarios, cantantes y otras personas importantes llegaron y tomaron sus lugares.\n",
      "Pronto, los funcionarios fronterizos y el personal de seguridad del aeropuerto comenzaron a desaparecer, dejando sus puestos sin personal y a los pasajeros sin vigilancia. \n",
      "La gente empezó a precipitarse sobre la pista.\n",
      "Finalmente, la delegación pudo abordar su vuelo de Pakistan International Airlines. Pero el control de tráfico aéreo ordenó al avión que no despegara y que esperara nuevas instrucciones.\n",
      "\"Nos pareció que los militantes talibanes tomarían el aeropuerto en cualquier momento\", dijo Sharifi. \n",
      "\"Pensamos en formas de defendernos usando lo que teníamos en caso de que subieran al avión. Lo único que yo podía usar que era lo suficientemente pesado era una batería de computadora portátil\".\n",
      "Domingo al mediodía\n",
      "De vuelta en el palacio presidencial, la situación también se estaba deteriorando. \n",
      "Ghani todavía estaba tratando frenéticamente de comunicarse con sus altos funcionarios en los ministerios de Defensa e Interior, con poco éxito.\n",
      "Un alto funcionario del gobierno le dijo a la BBC: \"Parecía que toda la maquinaria del gobierno se había derrumbado y la gente, incluidos los funcionarios de alto rango, se había dividido en grupos. Ninguno de estos grupos sabía nada sobre los demás\".\n",
      "\"Esperábamos algún tipo de orientación del palacio. Pero no llegó nada\".\n",
      "El círculo alrededor del propio Ghani se estaba volviendo cada vez más pequeño y aislado. \n",
      "Las únicas otras personas que tomaron decisiones clave con Ghani fueron su asesor de seguridad nacional, Hamdullah Mohib, y su jefe de gabinete, Fazel Fazly, dijeron varias fuentes a la BBC.\n",
      "Mohib, de 38 años, exembajador afgano en Estados Unidos educado en Occidente, quizás era el asistente más confiable de Ghani. \n",
      "A pesar de que no tener antecedentes militares o de seguridad, Ghani lo nombró asesor de seguridad nacional en 2018 y lo puso a cargo de decisiones militares cruciales.\n",
      "Fuentes dentro del palacio nos dijeron que, alrededor del mediodía, Mohib comenzó a presionar enérgicamente para una evacuación. \n",
      "Una hora antes se habían escuchado disparos fuera del palacio. El propio Ghani se mostró reacio a irse, según los que estaban allí. \n",
      "Mohib le advirtió al presidente que su vida estaba bajo una amenaza inminente.\n",
      "\"Le dijo que el Talibán estaba en camino y que lo capturarían y lo matarían. Estaba extremadamente preocupado\", señaló un informante del palacio.\n",
      "Mientras tanto, comenzaba a instalarse en Kabul una sensación de profunda incertidumbre.\n",
      "Un residente le dijo a la BBC: \"Estaba en la oficina, [y] alrededor de las 14:00 las redes sociales se empezaron a llenar de fotos de combatientes talibanes dentro de la ciudad. Los colegas empezaron a recoger sus cosas para irse\". \n",
      "\"No hablamos entre nosotros. Cuando salí de la oficina, las calles estaban llenas. Las tiendas estaban cerradas. Escuché disparos. Dudé de todos\".\n",
      "Varias fuentes sugieren que los guardias de seguridad personal del presidente se oponían al plan de que se fuera. \n",
      "Cuando tres helicópteros llegaron al palacio para llevarse al presidente Ghani, su esposa y sus ayudantes, hubo empujones y gritos entre los que subían a bordo y los guardias que se quedaron.\n",
      "Los testigos informan que se arrojaron bolsas al suelo cuando las personas subían al helicóptero. \n",
      "Algunos informes sugirieron que éstas contenían dinero en efectivo que se usaba para pagar a los guardias, aunque ha sido imposible verificar estos recuentos. \n",
      "El propio Ghani, en un mensaje posterior desde los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, ha negado las acusaciones de que abandonó el país con cantidades sustanciales de dinero.\n",
      "Alrededor de las 15:30, el presidente Ghani y sus colaboradores más cercanos, incluidos Mohib y Fazly, abandonaron el palacio a bordo de los helicópteros.\n",
      "Volaron a Termez, Uzbekistán, y luego a Emiratos Árabes Unidos. \n",
      "Horas más tarde, en imágenes transmitidas por todo el mundo, los combatientes talibanes triunfantes pero claramente sorprendidos fueron fotografiados en el mismo escritorio en el palacio presidencial donde el presidente Ghani había estado sentado unas horas antes.\n",
      "Un libro que estaba sobre el escritorio durante la conferencia telefónica matutina de Ghani todavía estaba allí, marcado en la misma página, aparentemente intacto. \n",
      "Pero ahora el Talibán estaba comenzando un nuevo capítulo.\n",
      "De vuelta en el aeropuerto, otros miembros de alto rango del gobierno esperaban. La noticia de la fuga de Ghani aún no se había filtrado.\n",
      "\"Literalmente, podría contar un par de docenas de funcionarios de muy alto rango, incluidos ministros, sentados y esperando junto a la pista\", declaró un alto funcionario del gobierno. \n",
      "\"Todos se preguntaban unos a otros sobre el paradero del presidente Ghani. Pero parecía que nadie sabía dónde estaba\".\n",
      "En la explanada, el vuelo PK6250 de Pakistan Airlines que transportaba a Sharifi y al resto de su delegación todavía estaba varado, cuatro horas y media después de que sus pasajeros abordaran por primera vez. \n",
      "El control del tráfico aéreo civil se había quedado en silencio.\n",
      "El piloto tuvo que tomar una decisión.\n",
      "Al otro lado del aeropuerto, en el lado militar, partían continuamente helicópteros Chinook y otros aviones militares estadounidenses.\n",
      "El piloto Maqsood Bajrani tomó una decisión de último minuto para despegar sin autorización, una acción que luego lo convertiría en un héroe en Pakistán. \n",
      "Le dijo a los medios locales que simplemente siguió a dos aviones militares que estaban despegando en la pista.\n",
      "Sharifi describió el alivio de la delegación afgana.\n",
      "\"Estábamos tan felices de haber despegado finalmente, pero al mismo tiempo, tristes porque no sabíamos con certeza cuándo podríamos regresar\".\n",
      "No sabían en ese momento que el presidente ya había huido.\n",
      "Unos días después, el presidente Ghani apareció en vivo en Facebook desde los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, donde se le había permitido permanecer por \"razones humanitarias\".\n",
      "Claramente herido por las críticas de que había huido de su país en su hora de necesidad, trató de corregir el hecho.\n",
      "\"No fue mi decisión dejar Kabul. Fue la decisión de mi equipo cercano de seguridad. Si me hubiera quedado, habría habido un derramamiento de sangre\", declaró.\n",
      "\"Y lo que había sucedido hace 25 años en Afganistán iba a suceder nuevamente. Me habrían ahorcado frente a los ojos del pueblo de Afganistán y esto habría sido un terrible desastre en nuestra historia\".\n",
      "Si bien la velocidad a la que los talibanes tomaron Kabul ese domingo por la tarde sorprendió a algunos, hubo indicios en otras partes del país.\n",
      "La BBC obtuvo información sobre las negociaciones locales que llevaron a la rendición de una provincia del sur al Talibán.\n",
      "Una fuente talibán en la provincia de Zabul, en la frontera con Pakistán, dijo que la retirada de Estados Unidos de la provincia en 2014 había dejado al ejército afgano sin apoyo material.\n",
      "\"Cuando las fuerzas estadounidenses llegaron a Zabul, ocuparon puestos de control y bases profesionales. Pero cuando se fueron, el ejército afgano no pudo tripularlos ni suministrarlos. Los talibanes cortaron sus líneas de suministro y les impidieron funcionar\", le dijo a la BBC un miembro de un equipo negociador talibán en el distrito de Shinkai en Zabul.\n",
      "Los combatientes talibanes, que ya controlaban gran parte del territorio rural, se hicieron cargo gradualmente de los puestos de control, obligando a las fuerzas del ejército afgano a regresar a sus cuarteles. \n",
      "A mediados de junio de 2021, la situación en Zabul se había inclinado claramente a favor del Talibán.\n",
      "\"Decidimos negociar con una Jirga (asamblea tribal), de acuerdo con nuestras tradiciones locales\", le dijo la fuente a la BBC.\n",
      "Las negociaciones se llevaron a cabo durante dos días, comenzando el 15 de junio, e involucraron a decenas de representantes de cada lado, encabezados por un comandante talibán local llamado Mukhlis y el vicegobernador de Zabul, Inayatullah Hotak. \n",
      "Sobre la mesa había dos temas principales: cómo garantizar la seguridad de las fuerzas del ejército afgano y cómo dividir las armas entre los talibanes y los lugareños.\n",
      "Al día siguiente se llegó a un acuerdo en el que los ancianos aceptaron entregar las fuerzas y las armas del ejército afgano a los talibanes, que les habían garantizado el paso seguro a la capital provincial, Qalat. \n",
      "Los soldados también recibieron 5000 afganis (alrededor de US$55) cada uno como pago, un arma ligera cada uno para protección personal y suficientes vehículos para evacuar la ciudad. \n",
      "Juntos, cientos de efectivos del ejército afgano abandonaron Shinkai el 16 de junio para dirigirse a Qalat, bajo la vigilancia de los talibanes.\n",
      "Nuestra fuente dice que uno a uno, varios cuarteles locales más en Zabul llegaron a acuerdos similares que garantizan el paso seguro.\n",
      "Días después, Kabul también caería.\n",
      "Para muchos en Afganistán, el domingo 15 de agosto marcó el punto de inflexión de una vida con promesas a otra vida sin ellas.\n",
      "Un residente nos dijo que al caer la noche, se dio cuenta de que las cosas habían cambiado para siempre.\n",
      "\"Ahora está oscuro y tranquilo afuera. Es la noche más triste de la historia. Kabul está conteniendo la respiración\".\n",

      "Title: Engineers grow pancreatic “organoids” that mimic the real thing \n",
      "\n",
      "Date: September 13, 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MIT engineers, in collaboration with scientists at Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, have developed a new way to grow tiny replicas of the pancreas, using either healthy or cancerous pancreatic cells. Their new models could help researchers develop and test potential drugs for pancreatic cancer, which is currently one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a specialized gel that mimics the extracellular environment surrounding the pancreas, the researchers were able to grow pancreatic “organoids,” allowing them to study the important interactions between pancreatic tumors and their environment. Unlike some of the gels now used to grow tissue, the new MIT gel is completely synthetic, easy to assemble and can be produced with a consistent composition every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The issue of reproducibility is a major one,” says Linda Griffith, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation and a professor of biological engineering and mechanical engineering. “The research community has been looking for ways to do more methodical cultures of these kinds of organoids, and especially to control the microenvironment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers have also shown that their new gel can be used to grow other types of tissue, including intestinal and endometrial tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griffith and Claus Jorgensen, a group leader at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears today in Nature Materials. The lead author is Christopher Below, a former graduate student at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mimicking the microenvironment\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, labs have used commercially available tissue-derived gel to grow organoids in a lab dish. However, as the most widely used commercial gel is a complex mixture of proteins, proteoglycans, and growth factors derived from a tumor grown in mice, it is variable from lot to lot and has undesirable components present, Griffith says. It also doesn’t always allow for growth of multiple types of cells. About 10 years ago, Griffith’s lab started to work on designing a synthetic gel that could be used to grow epithelial cells, which form the sheets that line most organs, along with other supportive cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gel they developed is based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), a polymer that is often used for medical applications because it doesn’t interact with living cells. By studying the biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix, which surrounds organs in the body, the researchers were able to identify features they could incorporate into the PEG gel to help cells grow in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key feature is the presence of molecules called peptide ligands, which interact with cell surface proteins called integrins. The sticky binding between ligands and integrins allows cells to adhere to the gel and form organoids. The researchers found that incorporating small synthetic peptides derived from fibronectin and collagen in their gels allowed them to grow a variety of epithelial tissues, including intestinal tissue. They showed that supportive cells called stromal cells, along with immune cells, can also thrive in this environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the new study, Griffith and Jorgensen wanted to see if the gel could also be used to support the growth of normal pancreatic organoids and pancreatic tumors. Traditionally, it has been difficult to grow pancreatic tissue in a manner that replicates both the cancerous cells and the supporting environment, because once pancreatic tumor cells are removed from the body, they lose their distinctive cancerous traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griffith’s lab developed a protocol to produce the new gel, and then teamed up with Jorgensen’s lab, which studies the biology of pancreatic cancer, to test it. Jorgensen and his students were able to produce the gel and use it to grow pancreatic organoids, using healthy or cancerous pancreatic cells derived from mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We got the protocol from Linda and we got the reagents in, and then it just worked,” Jorgensen says. “I think that speaks volumes of how robust the system is and how easy it is to implement in the lab.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Other approaches they had tried were too complicated or did not recapitulate the microenvironment seen in living tissues, he says. Using this gel, Jorgensen’s lab was able to compare the pancreatic organoids to tissues they have studied in living mice, and they found that the tumor organoids express many of the same integrins seen in pancreatic tumors.

      " TITLE : Toward a smarter electronic health record \n",
      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic health records have been widely adopted with the hope they would save time and improve the quality of patient care. But due to fragmented interfaces and tedious data entry procedures, physicians often spend more time navigating these systems than they do interacting with patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at MIT and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center are combining machine learning and human-computer interaction to create a better electronic health record (EHR). They developed MedKnowts, a system that unifies the processes of looking up medical records and documenting patient information into a single, interactive interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driven by artificial intelligence, this “smart” EHR automatically displays customized, patient-specific medical records when a clinician needs them. MedKnowts also provides autocomplete for clinical terms and auto-populates fields with patient information to help doctors work more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the origins of EHRs, there was this tremendous enthusiasm that getting all this information organized would be helpful to be able to track billing records, report statistics to the government, and provide data for scientific research. But few stopped to ask the deep questions around whether they would be of use for the clinician. I think a lot of clinicians feel they have had this burden of EHRs put on them for the benefit of bureaucracies and scientists and accountants. We came into this project asking how EHRs might actually benefit clinicians,” says David Karger, professor of computer science in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and senior author of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research was co-authored by CSAIL graduate students Luke Murray, who is the lead author, Divya Gopinath, and Monica Agrawal. Other authors include Steven Horng, an emergency medicine attending physician and clinical lead for machine learning at the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and David Sontag, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of CSAIL and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. It will be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "A problem-oriented tool\n",
      "\n",
      "To design an EHR that would benefit doctors, the researchers had to think like doctors.\n",
      "\n",
      "They created a note-taking editor with a side panel that displays relevant information from the patient’s medical history. That historical information appears in the form of cards that are focused on particular problems or concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, if MedKnowts identifies the clinical term “diabetes” in the text as a clinician types, the system automatically displays a “diabetes card” containing medications, lab values, and snippets from past records that are relevant to diabetes treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most EHRs store historical information on separate pages and list medications or lab values alphabetically or chronologically, forcing the clinician to search through data to find the information they need, Murray says. MedKnowts only displays information relevant to the particular concept the clinician is writing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a closer match to the way doctors think about information. A lot of times, doctors will do this subconsciously. They will look through a medications page and only focus on the medications that are relevant to the current conditions. We are helping to do that process automatically and hopefully move some things out of the doctor’s head so they have more time to think about the complex part, which is determining what is wrong with the patient and coming up with a treatment plan,” Murray says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pieces of interactive text called chips serve as links to related cards. As a physician types a note, the autocomplete system recognizes clinical terms, such as medications, lab values, or conditions, and transforms them into chips. Each chip is displayed as a word or phrase that has been highlighted in a certain color depending on its category (red for a medical condition, green for a medication, yellow for a procedure, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the use of autocomplete, structured data on the patient’s conditions, symptoms, and medication usage is collected with no additional effort from the physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sontag says he hopes the advance will “change the paradigm of how to create large-scale health datasets for studying disease progression and assessing the real-world effectiveness of treatments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year-long iterative design process, the researchers tested MedKnowts by deploying the software in the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. They worked with an emergency physician and four hospital scribes who enter notes into the electronic health record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deploying the software in an emergency department, where doctors operate in a high-stress environment, involved a delicate balancing act, Agrawal says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the biggest challenges we faced was trying to get people to shift what they currently do. Doctors who have used the same system, and done the same dance of clicks so many times, form a sort of muscle memory. Whenever you are going to make a change, there is a question of is this worth it? And we definitely found that some features had greater usage than others,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic complicated the deployment, too. The researchers had been visiting the emergency department to get a sense of the workflow, but were forced to end those visits due to Covid-19 and were unable to be in the hospital while the system was being deployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite those initial challenges, MedKnowts became popular with the scribes over the course of the one-month deployment. They gave the system an average rating of 83.75 (out of 100) for usability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scribes found the autocomplete function especially useful for speeding up their work, according to survey results. Also, the color-coded chips helped them quickly scan notes for relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those initial results are promising, but as the researchers consider the feedback and work on future iterations of MedKnowts, they plan to proceed with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we are trying to do here is smooth the pathway for doctors and let them accelerate. There is some risk there. Part of the purpose of bureaucracy is to slow things down and make sure all the i’s are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. And if we have a computer dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s for doctors, that may actually be countering the goals of the bureaucracy, which is to force doctors to think twice before they make a decision. We have to be thinking about how to protect doctors and patients from the consequences of making the doctors more efficient,” Karger says.\n",
      "\n",
      "A longer-term vision\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers plan to improve the machine learning algorithms that drive MedKnowts so the system can more effectively highlight parts of the medical record that are most relevant, Agrawal says.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also want to consider the needs of different medical users. The researchers designed MedKnowts with an emergency department in mind — a setting where doctors are typically seeing patients for the first time. A primary care physician who knows their patients much better would likely have some different needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the longer-term, the researchers envision creating an adaptive system that clinicians can contribute to. For example, perhaps a doctor realizes a certain cardiology term is missing from MedKnowts and adds that information to a card, which would update the system for all users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team is exploring commercialization as an avenue for further deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to build tools that let doctors create their own tools. We don’t expect doctors to learn to be programmers, but with the right support they might be able to radically customize whatever medical applications they are using to really suit their own needs and preferences,” Karger says.\n",

      " TITLE : RNA-targeting enzyme expands the CRISPR toolkit \n",
      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research have discovered a bacterial enzyme that they say could expand scientists’ CRISPR toolkit, making it easy to cut and edit RNA with the kind of precision that, until now, has only been available for DNA editing. The enzyme, called Cas7-11, modifies RNA targets without harming cells, suggesting that in addition to being a valuable research tool, it provides a fertile platform for therapeutic applications.\n",
      "“This new enzyme is like the Cas9 of RNA,” says McGovern Fellow Omar Abudayyeh, referring to the DNA-cutting CRISPR enzyme that has revolutionized modern biology by making DNA editing fast, inexpensive, and exact. “It creates two precise cuts and doesn't destroy the cell in the process, like other enzymes,” he adds.\n",
      "Up until now, only one other family of RNA-targeting enzymes, Cas13, has extensively been developed for RNA targeting applications. However, when Cas13 recognizes its target, it shreds any RNAs in the cell, destroying the cell along the way. Like Cas9, Cas7-11 is part of a programmable system; it can be directed at specific RNA targets using a CRISPR guide. Abudayyeh, McGovern Fellow Jonathan Gootenberg, and their colleagues discovered Cas7-11 through a deep exploration of the CRISPR systems found in the microbial world. Their findings were recently reported in the journal Nature.\n",
      "Exploring natural diversity\n",
      "Like other CRISPR proteins, Cas7-11 is used by bacteria as a defense mechanism against viruses. After encountering a new virus, bacteria that employ the CRISPR system keep a record of the infection in the form of a small snippet of the pathogen’s genetic material. Should that virus reappear, the CRISPR system is activated, guided by a small piece of RNA to destroy the viral genome and eliminate the infection.\n",
      "These ancient immune systems are widespread and diverse, with different bacteria deploying different proteins to counter their viral invaders.\n",
      "“Some target DNA, some target RNA. Some are very efficient in cleaving the target but have some toxicity, and others do not. They introduce different types of cuts, they can differ in specificity — and so on,” says Eugene Koonin, an evolutionary biologist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n",
      "Abudayyeh, Gootenberg, and Koonin have been scouring genome sequences to learn about the natural diversity of CRISPR systems — and to mine them for potential tools. The idea, Abudayyeh says, is to take advantage of the work that evolution has already done in engineering protein machines.\n",
      "“We don’t know what we’ll find,” Abudayyeh says, “but let’s just explore and see what’s out there.”\n",
      "As the team was poring through public databases to examine the components of different bacterial defense systems, a protein from a bacterium that had been isolated from Tokyo Bay caught their attention. Its amino acid sequence indicated that it belonged to a class of CRISPR systems that use large, multiprotein machines to find and cleave their targets. But this protein appeared to have everything it needed to carry out the job on its own. Other known single-protein Cas enzymes, including the Cas9 protein that has been widely adopted for DNA editing, belong to a separate class of CRISPR systems — but Cas7-11 blurs the boundaries of the CRISPR classification system, Koonin says.\n",
      "The enzyme, which the team eventually named Cas7-11, was attractive from an engineering perspective, because single proteins are easier to deliver to cells and make better tools than their complex counterparts. But its composition also signaled an unexpected evolutionary history. The team found evidence that through evolution, the components of a more complex Cas machine had fused together to make the Cas7-11 protein. Gootenberg equates this to discovering a bat when you had previously assumed that birds are the only animals that fly, thereby recognizing that there are multiple evolutionary paths to flight. “It totally changes the landscape of how these systems are thought about, both functionally and evolutionarily,” he says.\n",
      "Precision editing\n",
      "When Gootenberg and Abudayyeh produced the Cas7-11 protein in their lab and began experimenting with it, they realized this unusual enzyme offered a powerful means to manipulate and study RNA. When they introduced it into cells along with an RNA guide, it made remarkably precise cuts, snipping its targets while leaving other RNA undisturbed. This meant they could use Cas7-11 to change specific letters in the RNA code, correcting errors introduced by genetic mutations. They were also able to program Cas7-11 to either stabilize or destroy particular RNA molecules inside cells, which gave them the ability to adjust the levels of the proteins encoded by those RNAs.\n",
      "Abudayyeh and Gootenberg also found that Cas7-11’s ability to cut RNA could be dampened by a protein that appeared likely to also be involved in triggering programmed cell death, suggesting a possible link between CRISPR defense and a more extreme response to infection.\n",
      "The team showed that a gene therapy vector can deliver the complete Cas7-11 editing system to cells and that Cas7-11 does not compromise cells’ health. They hope that with further development, the enzyme might one day be used to edit disease-causing sequences out of a patient’s RNA so their cells can produce healthy proteins, or to dial down the level of a protein that is doing harm due to genetic disease.\n",
      "“We think that the unique way that Cas7-11 cuts enables many interesting and diverse applications,” Gootenberg says, noting that no other CRISPR tool cuts RNA so precisely. “It's yet another great example of how these basic-biology driven explorations can yield new tools for therapeutics and diagnostics,” he adds. “And we're certainly still just scratching the surface of what's out there in natural diversity.”\n",

      " TITLE : Using adversarial attacks to refine molecular energy predictions \n",
      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being used to predict new materials, the rate and yield of chemical reactions, and drug-target interactions, among others. For these applications, they are orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods such as quantum mechanical simulations. \n",
      "The price for this agility, however, is reliability. Because machine learning models only interpolate, they may fail when used outside the domain of training data.\n",
      "But the part that worried Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, the Jeffrey Cheah Career Development Professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and graduate students Daniel Schwalbe-Koda and Aik Rui Tan was that establishing the limits of these machine learning (ML) models is tedious and labor-intensive. \n",
      "This is particularly true for predicting ‘‘potential energy surfaces” (PES), or the map of a molecule's energy in all its configurations. These surfaces encode the complexities of a molecule into flatlands, valleys, peaks, troughs, and ravines. The most stable configurations of a system are usually in the deep pits — quantum mechanical chasms from which atoms and molecules typically do not escape. \n",
      "In a recent Nature Communications paper, the research team presented a way to demarcate the “safe zone” of a neural network by using “adversarial attacks.” Adversarial attacks have been studied for other classes of problems, such as image classification, but this is the first time that they are being used to sample molecular geometries in a PES. \n",
      "“People have been using uncertainty for active learning for years in ML potentials. The key difference is that they need to run the full ML simulation and evaluate if the NN was reliable, and if it wasn't, acquire more data, retrain and re-simulate. Meaning that it takes a long time to nail down the right model, and one has to run the ML simulation many times” explains Gómez-Bombarelli.\n",
      "The Gómez-Bombarelli lab at MIT works on a synergistic synthesis of first-principles simulation and machine learning that greatly speeds up this process. The actual simulations are run only for a small fraction of these molecules, and all those data are fed into a neural network that learns how to predict the same properties for the rest of the molecules. They have successfully demonstrated these methods for a growing class of novel materials that includes catalysts for producing hydrogen from water, cheaper polymer electrolytes for electric vehicles,  zeolites for molecular sieving, magnetic materials, and more. \n",
      "The challenge, however, is that these neural networks are only as smart as the data they are trained on.  Considering the PES map, 99 percent of the data may fall into one pit, totally missing valleys that are of more interest. \n",
      "Such wrong predictions can have disastrous consequences — think of a self-driving car that fails to identify a person crossing the street.\n",
      "One way to find out the uncertainty of a model is to run the same data through multiple versions of it. \n",
      "For this project, the researchers had multiple neural networks predict the potential energy surface from the same data. Where the network is fairly sure of the prediction, the variation between the outputs of different networks is minimal and the surfaces largely converge. When the network is uncertain, the predictions of different models vary widely, producing a range of outputs, any of which could be the correct surface. \n",
      "The spread in the predictions of a “committee of neural networks” is the “uncertainty” at that point. A good model should not just indicate the best prediction, but also indicate the uncertainty about each of these predictions. It’s like the neural network is saying “this property for material A will have a value of X and I’m highly confident about it.”\n",
      "This could have been an elegant solution but for the sheer scale of the combinatorial space. “Each simulation (which is ground feed for the neural network) may take from tens to thousands of CPU hours,” explains Schwalbe-Koda. For the results to be meaningful, multiple models must be run over a sufficient number of points in the PES, an extremely time-consuming process. \n",
      "Instead, the new approach only samples data points from regions of low prediction confidence, corresponding to specific geometries of a molecule. These molecules are then stretched or deformed slightly so that the uncertainty of the neural network committee is maximized. Additional data are computed for these molecules through simulations and then added to the initial training pool. \n",
      "The neural networks are trained again, and a new set of uncertainties are calculated. This process is repeated until the uncertainty associated with various points on the surface becomes well-defined and cannot be decreased any further. \n",
      "Gómez-Bombarelli explains, “We aspire to have a model that is perfect in the regions we care about (i.e., the ones that the simulation will visit) without having had to run the full ML simulation, by making sure that we make it very good in high-likelihood regions where it isn't.”\n",
      "The paper presents several examples of this approach, including predicting complex supramolecular interactions in zeolites. These materials are cavernous crystals that act as molecular sieves with high shape selectivity. They find applications in catalysis, gas separation, and ion exchange, among others.\n",
      "Because performing simulations of large zeolite structures is very costly, the researchers show how their method can provide significant savings in computational simulations. They used more than 15,000 examples to train a neural network to predict the potential energy surfaces for these systems. Despite the large cost required to generate the dataset, the final results are mediocre, with only around 80 percent of the neural network-based simulations being successful. To improve the performance of the model using traditional active learning methods, the researchers calculated an additional 5,000 data points, which improved the performance of the neural network potentials to 92 percent.\n",
      "However, when the adversarial approach is used to retrain the neural networks, the authors saw a performance jump to 97 percent using only 500 extra points. That’s a remarkable result, the researchers say, especially considering that each of these extra points takes hundreds of CPU hours. \n",
      "This could be the most realistic method to probe the limits of models that researchers use to predict the behavior of materials and the progress of chemical reactions.\n",

      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the addition of computers, laser cutters have rapidly become a relatively simple and powerful tool, with software controlling shiny machinery that can chop metals, woods, papers, and plastics. While this curious amalgam of materials feels encompassing, users still face difficulties distinguishing between stockpiles of visually similar materials, where the wrong stuff can make gooey messes, give off horrendous odors, or worse, spew out harmful chemicals.\n",
      "Addressing what might not be totally apparent to the naked eye, scientists from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) came up with “SensiCut,” a smart material-sensing platform for laser cutters. In contrast to conventional, camera-based approaches that can easily misidentify materials, SensiCut uses a more nuanced fusion. It identifies materials using deep learning and an optical method called “speckle sensing,” a technique that uses a laser to sense a surface’s microstructure, enabled by just one image-sensing add-on.\n",
      "A little assistance from SensiCut could go a long way — it could potentially protect users from hazardous waste, provide material-specific knowledge, suggest subtle cutting adjustments for better results, and even engrave various items like garments or phone cases that consist of multiple materials. \n",
      "“By augmenting standard laser cutters with lensless image sensors, we can easily identify visually similar materials commonly found in workshops and reduce overall waste,” says Mustafa Doga Dogan, PhD candidate at MIT CSAIL. “We do this by leveraging a material’s micron-level surface structure, which is a unique characteristic even when visually similar to another type. Without that, you’d likely have to make an educated guess on the correct material name from a large database.” \n",

      "Beyond using cameras, sticker tags (like QR codes) have also been used on individual sheets to identify them. Which seems straightforward, however, during laser cutting, if the code is cut off from the main sheet, it can’t be identified for future uses. Also, if an incorrect tag is attached, the laser cutter will assume the wrong material type. \n",
      "To successfully play a round of “what material is this,” the team trained SensiCut’s deep neural network on images of 30 different material types of over 38,000 images, where it could then differentiate between things like acrylic, foamboard, and styrene, and even provide further guidance on power and speed settings.\n",
      "In one experiment, the team decided to build a face shield, which would require distinguishing between transparent materials from a workshop. The user would first select a design file in the interface, and then use the “pinpoint” function to get the laser moving to identify the material type at a point on the sheet. The laser interacts with the very tiny features of the surface and the rays are reflected off it, arriving at the pixels of the image sensor and producing a unique 2-D image. The system could then alert or flag the user that their sheet is polycarbonate, which means potentially highly toxic flames if cut by a laser. \n",
      "The speckle imaging technique was used inside a laser cutter, with low-cost, off-the shelf-components, like a Raspberry Pi Zero microprocessor board. To make it compact, the team designed and 3-D printed a lightweight mechanical housing.\n",
      "Beyond laser cutters, the team envisions a future where SensiCut’s sensing technology could eventually be integrated into other fabrication tools like 3-D printers. To capture additional nuances, they also plan to extend the system by adding thickness detection, a pertinent variable in material makeup. \n",
      "Dogan wrote the paper alongside undergraduate researchers Steven Acevedo Colon and Varnika Sinha in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Associate Professor Kaan Akşit of University College London, and MIT Professor Stefanie Mueller.  \n",
      "The team will present their work at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) in October. The work was supported by the NSF Award 1716413, the MIT Portugal Initiative, and the MIT Mechanical Engineering MathWorks Seed Fund Program.\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Work on MIT’s Strategic Action Plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion started last fall, and the plan’s first draft was released this past March. Powered by inputs and feedback from three dozen community engagement sessions and a steady stream of email responses from students, staff, faculty, postdocs, alumni, and others, the plan is being revised and updated over the summer with hopes for a fall release. The development of the strategic plan is being led by Institute Community and Equity Officer John Dozier, along with Deputy ICEO Maryanne Kirkbride and Associate Provost Tim Jamison.\n",
      "In a conversation prepared for MIT News, Provost Martin Schmidt described the plan’s importance to the Institute, the processes that will lead to its successful implementation, and MIT’s generational opportunity for change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What are the opportunities and challenges you face as provost in trying to advance a strategic plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion at MIT? \n",
      "\n",
      "A: We are living through a transformational time — from increasing political polarization; to the Covid-19 pandemic; to the deep changes we are seeing in how our society talks about race, gender, and other identity issues. In the past, some might have considered these issues as happening “outside” our campus. We know today all of these challenges, and others, are landing squarely inside the MIT community. Fundamentally, I want to make sure we recognize the moment we’re in and work to build a community that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategic action plan is MIT’s opportunity to define much of the work we need to do. It’s a platform for building a rich network that’s mutually supportive. It’s an opportunity to amplify and propagate good ideas and practices across the Institute. We need to make sure good ideas spread, and to share lessons learned about things that don’t work.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know MIT is decentralized. Sometimes collaboration doesn’t happen naturally. However, there is already a huge range of productive interdepartmental and interdisciplinary relationships on our campus, are they’re generating tremendous results. If we capture and redirect some of this energy and build a connected network of diversity, equity, and inclusion activities at MIT, it will elevate everything we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategic plan is also a pathway to building a network of accountability. Everyone — by which I mean every organizational unit at the Institute — needs a plan for its community. MIT has a range of distinct cultures and communities. What the strategic plan will give us is a unifying framework, a set of principles, and the tools to make sure that local-area planning is well thought out and fits together — that they, too, add up to a whole greater than the parts. And across this framework, of course, we’re going to measure and track the success of everything we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we need to be smart about resource allocation. MIT has already made crucial investments in diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as the hiring of six new assistant deans for diversity in the schools and the college. We need to build on those investments. We also need to be prepared to examine legacy programs and determine if they suit current needs and priorities. Tracking the effectiveness of the investments we’ve made is as important as making new ones.\n",
      "Q: How do you think the plan will impact the campus community?\n",
      "A: A more diverse and inclusive community leads to better outcomes, no matter how you measure them. It will also lead to a better and more impactful MIT. We want this plan to cultivate and promote an environment where everyone feels empowered to generate better ideas, to make more informed decisions, and to pursue the opportunities they are passionate about. This isn’t just for students, or faculty, or staff, or our postdocs — this plan is for every person who is a part of the MIT community.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why we need local planning. For the strategic plan to reach effectively across MIT functional areas — from staff professional development, to graduate student admissions, to faculty recruitment, to our work with external partners — it must be informed by and connected with the expertise in those areas. This level of detail and engagement makes the process complicated, but I can’t see an alternative, at least not one that will actually work and get us where we want to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What do you think will be the most important outcome of the plan? \n",
      "\n",
      "A: I think there are internal and external dimensions to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internally, I don’t think MIT has ever done something this unifying before. We need to develop some new capabilities and some new muscles around collaboration and coordination. The Provost’s Office is among the few places at MIT that is sufficiently central to help move the strategic plan forward. And we need partners — the chancellor, Human Resources, the vice president for research, and others — if we’re going to get everyone at MIT rowing in the same direction. Plus, those of us in more central roles need active and meaningful participation from the members of our communities in order to accomplish our goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old saying that no organization ever centralized its way out of a problem applies here. Centralization is not our goal. We need to provide enough central support to make the pieces come together. I think that’s new and different for MIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Externally, I am always humbled and surprised by how much people pay attention to MIT. Our peer schools, especially STEM-oriented universities, often look to us as they reflect on what they’re doing. There are some widely acknowledged challenges when it comes to diversity in STEM fields. We have a generational opportunity to address these challenges. We might not be doing any better than our peers, but we are a place where people look to for cues and models. If we can help propel the community of STEM institutions — through collaboration and sharing of best practices — MIT can propel change beyond our campus.\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you gave students around the world the power to study and manipulate genes in a test tube, what would they do with it?\n",
      "MiniPCR bio first began selling its portable, inexpensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines in 2013. The machines allow users to multiply specific strands of DNA in minutes, following along with experiments through a phone app.\n",
      "Since then, the founders have been amazed at the amount of learning and research that has come from the devices.\n",
      "Researchers have taken the machines into the Amazon rainforest, the deep oceans, and onto remote islands to do things like classify the DNA of the Ebola virus, sequence genes in endangered animals, and monitor for disease. Hundreds of thousands of students have used the machines for hands-on classroom experiments. The machines have even gone to the International Space Station as part of miniPCR bio’s Genes in Space initiative.\n",
      "The space experiments are designed by middle and high school students as one of miniPCR bio’s projects in education, its main focus. To date, miniPCR bio has sold more than 20,000 of its machines to schools in 80 countries across the globe.\n",
      "“I still find it shocking,” miniPCR bio’s co-founder Ezequiel Alvarez Saavedra PhD ’08 says of the company’s impact. “We get emails from teachers every week thanking us and telling us how much learning improved in the classroom because of our machine. I never would have thought this would happen.”\n",
      "Making PCR mainstream\n",
      "Alvarez Saavedra conducted thousands of experiments with PCR machines, which help researchers replicate specific pieces of DNA and RNA, as part of his PhD work at MIT studying the C. elegans worm. After completing his PhD in 2008, he wasn’t sure how to continue his research career, but he’d worked at MIT’s Hobby Shop in his free time and knew he liked building things, so he began working with a small engineering firm to design a simpler machine.\n",
      "“I wasn't thinking of starting a company at all,” Alvarez Saavedra says. “I just liked engineering and I was hoping to learn more about it.”\n",
      "PCR machines work through a series of temperature changes. First, DNA is heated up inside the machine’s sample tubes. The heat breaks the DNA’s two strands apart. Then, during a cool down phase, molecules specifying the start and end point of the DNA that scientists want to replicate latch onto their targets. As the PCR machine heats the sample back up, an enzyme fills in the target section of DNA, matching the A nucleotides with Ts and the C nucleotides with Gs. The heat-cool-heat cycle is repeated over and over until millions of copies of the target section have been generated.\n",
      "“PCR is really the workhorse of molecular biology,” Alvarez Saavedra says. “PCR lets you zoom into your region of interest — the starting material could be an entire genome or a small piece of DNA — and then do something with it. You can sequence it, for example, or you could remove a piece of it.”\n",
      "Traditional PCR machines cost thousands of dollars and typically use thermoelectric cooling to change temperatures. MiniPCR’s machines, the most popular of which costs $650, use a fan and a thin-film heater, simplifying their design and making their operation far less energy-intensive.\n",
      "Those changes make the machines cheap. They’re also far easier to use than their lab-based counterparts. A simple app lets users select what kind of experiment they want to run, and a temperature graph with animated depictions lets students and researchers follow along at every stage.\n",
      "In 2013, Alvarez Saavedra partnered with Sebastian Kraves, a fellow Argentinian who’d earned his PhD at Harvard Medical School, to consider the best use case for the new invention. The co-founders decided to try expanding access to PCR machines for middle and high school students around the globe.\n",
      "To show educators the machines for the first time, the founders attended a professional development training session for teachers at MIT.\n",
      "“We showed it for 10 minutes and a teacher at the back of the room immediately said, ‘I want 10 of those,’” Alvarez Saavedra remembers. “We thought okay, there's something here.”\n",
      "The founders ended up building the first 20 machines themselves, storing growing numbers of them in Ezequiel’s living room and basement until his wife suggested they find an office.\n",
      "Fortunately, miniPCR bio was quickly gaining traction in the education space. Many schools buy batches of miniPCR machines for groups of students to work with directly.\n",
      "“U.S. schools have been teaching PCR for years, but pretty much no one at the time had PCR machines,” Alvarez Saavedra says. “If a school did have a PCR machine, it would sit at the back of the classroom. When you're teaching you want small groups of students doing experiments that allows each one to be more hands-on.”\n",
      "As miniPCR bio’s impact on education scaled, it also gained a loyal following among researchers who appreciate the device’s low price point, efficiency, and suitability to travel to remote regions.\n",
      "Researchers have run the machines off batteries charged with solar panels and done experiments without leaving the field. When one researcher was trying to sequence the Ebola virus in a makeshift lab in Sierra Leone, the miniPCR machines he’d brought to train lab technicians proved more effective than the traditional — far more expensive — PCR machines he’d brought for his work.\n",
      "“It’s very nice to get reminded what you're doing has an impact,” Alvarez Saavedra says.\n",
      "PCR and beyond\n",
      "Early on, the founders had the idea for students to design experiments for astronauts to run in space. The idea grew into a national competition held in partnership with Boeing that invites middle and high school students to propose pioneering DNA experiments that address challenges in space exploration. Finalist teams receive miniPCR machines for their schools, and winners get to see their experiments carried out in the International Space Station.\n",
      "“Kids find space and molecular biology very exciting,” Alvarez Saavedra says.\n",
      "MiniPCR has done eight missions so far. The program is just one example of the miniPCR team’s ability to keep innovating. The company also offers inexpensive systems for visualizing DNA and enzymes. It’s also developed projects for running classroom experiments using gene editing and synthetic biology. The latter project, called Biobits, was codeveloped in the lab of Jim Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science at MIT.\n",
      "Biobits gives students a hands-on introduction to synthetic biology by letting them create molecular factories that churn out brightly colored proteins, functional enzymes, and more. Ally Huang, a grad student in Collins’ lab who helped develop Biobits, joined the miniPCR team to help launch the first Biobits labs and has helped scale the program to classrooms across the country.\n",
      "“We try to go where the exciting science is,” Alvarez Saavedra says. “With all these programs, it’s been crazy. You put it out and you start hearing from people in all these crazy places. In the beginning, this wasn’t even supposed to be a company. But it’s incredibly simple. I guess that’s the beauty of it.”\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, Rodrigo Ochigame is reading Russian science fiction, Yugoslav art history, Indian philosophy, and Afro-Caribbean political theory. They are listening to Belgian electroacoustic music, Mongolian experimental rock, and Ethiopian jazz. Occasionally, the PhD student in the Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS) even throws dice to select a new MBTA stop to explore. More often, they apply this practice on the MIT campus, randomly attending departmental seminars on topics ranging from astrophysics to macroeconomics to neurobiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ochigame’s freewheeling curiosity actually stems from a deep conviction about disrupting cultural assumptions — especially their own. “That’s something I’m trying to do with myself in everyday life. Whether it’s about reading literature or walking around new neighborhoods or attending research seminars in different disciplines, it’s a practice of intentionally unsettling yourself, of continually exposing yourself to divergent perspectives, so the ideas that are most familiar to you are disrupted,” they say.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, Ochigame discovers many of the literary and musical works they are interested in through alternative search engines that they designed. For example, Search Atlas, a platform Ochigame developed in collaboration with computer scientist Katherine Ye, broadens a user’s search terms into a worldwide search for content. In so doing, the site reveals the geopolitical information boundaries embedded in conventional search engines like Google — boundaries that are invisible to most.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Searching for multiplicity, for a plurality of intellectual traditions and for possibly marginalized perspectives, is the key principle behind the alternative search engines that I design. I want to expose people to ideas they wouldn’t find otherwise.” That principle permeates all aspects of Ochigame’s life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial separation\n",
      "\n",
      "Ochigame grew up in a family of Japanese immigrants in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, a region close to Bolivia, Paraguay, and the Pantanal tropical wetland. They describe Mato Grosso as a highly “syncretic” environment, where many different cultures, languages, and beliefs interweave.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s really a place of cultural and linguistic syncretism. My own family had a mix of Buddhism, Christianity, and atheism. And in the border region, you also grow up amid many other influences, not only Portuguese and Spanish but also Lebanese, Okinawan, Guarani, Kaiowá, Terena, Afro-Brazilian. From an early age, I suppose, I’ve always been very puzzled by the diversity of available ways of understanding the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the seeds of their epistemological bent were sown in their hometown, Ochigame’s blossoming interest in computer science took root on the streets of Mato Grosso. One day while out walking, at age 13, Ochigame happened upon some other kids playing with an educational robotics kit. Captivated by the activity, which was expensive and unavailable at school, Ochigame began to learn about programming and engineering on the internet, largely through free video lectures from MIT OpenCourseWare. They built robots from cheaper microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, ultimately gaining national recognition in Brazilian robotics competitions. By college, Ochigame was committed to studying computer science.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon after arriving at the University of California at Berkeley, more philosophical questions began to sprout in Ochigame’s mind. They enrolled in courses in the humanities and social sciences, and came to question the dominance of Western epistemological frameworks in computer science. The classes inspired them to unmask the implicit assumptions embedded in the supposedly “universal” formal models that computer scientists rely on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Algorithms encode the cultural assumptions of their designers,” Ochigame explains. “Computer scientists tend to think of their formal models as universal, but I see those models as products of particular cultural assumptions, economic conditions, and historical contingencies. Because of a false impression of universality, the orthodox models are rarely questioned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such dogmatism, according to Ochigame, marginalizes important ideas. For example, their historical research uncovered that after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuban information scientists developed library systems that sought to give visibility to marginalized points of view — a principle Ochigame now employs in their alternative search engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "A broader view\n",
      "\n",
      "When they considered graduate school, Ochigame sought a hybrid space where they could train in the humanities and think about computing from this different lens. The HASTS program at MIT has been a perfect fit. Under the guidance of Stefan Helmreich, the Elting E. Morison Professor of Anthropology, Ochigame’s graduate work has incorporated reading hundreds of books in anthropology, history, philosophy, and computer science, as well as traveling around the world to visit archives and conduct interviews with mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. The flexibility of the curriculum has allowed their ideas to mushroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even the most universalistic formal models of computation, like mathematical logic or Turing machines, encode particular cultural assumptions. I’m interested in how researchers from around the world have developed unorthodox models based on different assumptions. For example: nonclassical systems of logic from Brazil, nonbinary Turing machines from India, nonlinear electronic circuits from Japan, socialist frameworks of information science from Cuba. All over the world, people have imagined radically different ways of computing,” Ochigame says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond their research, Ochigame has found space at MIT to disrupt “universal” truths. As a teaching assistant for the popular course 21A.157 (The Meaning of Life), Ochigame led students in questioning cultural assumptions around topics like family, sex, and money. They also contributed to 6.036 (Introduction to Machine Learning), for which they co-designed the curriculum around ethical and social issues in computing and artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the intellectual side of things, I couldn’t have asked for a better place than MIT,” Ochigame says. “It is, in fact, the only place I’ve ever felt a certain sense of belonging. The HASTS program is both supportive and transformative. My advisor is a model teacher who has incessantly disrupted my assumptions. I’ve had a wonderful time.” They add, “But, politically, I’m critical of the Institute. Going around multiple departments, I’ve become intimately aware of how funders shape research agendas. I’m worried by the Institute’s dependence on military and corporate sponsorship, because this dependence restricts the questions we ask.” For Ochigame, keeping a broad perspective should be not only a personal endeavor, but also a community and institutional one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting that perspective, Ochigame’s living situation — cooperative housing in Cambridge, Massachusetts — comprises a multigenerational community of cultural and professional diversity. They enjoy the variety of guests that pass through, from street musicians to traveling monks, and can often be found chatting in the common areas and learning about those around them. Despite this plurality, the community is also one of shared values. “As a co-op, we make decisions democratically. We don’t have landlords. We strive to be a meeting place for diverse political struggles: prison abolition, queer and trans liberation, immigrant rights, and more,” they say.\n",

      "“How do you make sense of multiplicity? It’s tempting to say that a single model of the world is the correct, rational, or scientifically valid one, while the others are not,” they say. “But another approach is to just take a step back and appreciate the variety of possible ways of making sense of the world out there.”\n",

      " TITLE : Exact symbolic artificial intelligence for faster, better assessment of AI fairness \n",
      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The justice system, banks, and private companies use algorithms to make decisions that have profound impacts on people’s lives. Unfortunately, those algorithms are sometimes biased — disproportionately impacting people of color as well as individuals in lower income classes when they apply for loans or jobs, or even when courts decide what bail should be set while a person awaits trial.\n",
      "MIT researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence programming language that can assess the fairness of algorithms more exactly, and more quickly, than available alternatives.\n",
      "Their Sum-Product Probabilistic Language (SPPL) is a probabilistic programming system. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field at the intersection of programming languages and artificial intelligence that aims to make AI systems much easier to develop, with early successes in computer vision, common-sense data cleaning, and automated data modeling. Probabilistic programming languages make it much easier for programmers to define probabilistic models and carry out probabilistic inference — that is, work backward to infer probable explanations for observed data.\n",
      "“There are previous systems that can solve various fairness questions. Our system is not the first; but because our system is specialized and optimized for a certain class of models, it can deliver solutions thousands of times faster,” says Feras Saad, a PhD student in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and first author on a recent paper describing the work. Saad adds that the speedups are not insignificant: The system can be up to 3,000 times faster than previous approaches.\n",
      "SPPL gives fast, exact solutions to probabilistic inference questions such as \"How likely is the model to recommend a loan to someone over age 40?\" or \"Generate 1,000 synthetic loan applicants, all under age 30, whose loans will be approved.\" These inference results are based on SPPL programs that encode probabilistic models of what kinds of applicants are likely, a priori, and also how to classify them. Fairness questions that SPPL can answer include \"Is there a difference between the probability of recommending a loan to an immigrant and nonimmigrant applicant with the same socioeconomic status?\" or “What’s the probability of a hire, given that the candidate is qualified for the job and from an underrepresented group?\"\n",
      "SPPL is different from most probabilistic programming languages, as SPPL only allows users to write probabilistic programs for which it can automatically deliver exact probabilistic inference results. SPPL also makes it possible for users to check how fast inference will be, and therefore avoid writing slow programs. In contrast, other probabilistic programming languages such as Gen and Pyro allow users to write down probabilistic programs where the only known ways to do inference are approximate — that is, the results include errors whose nature and magnitude can be hard to characterize.\n",
      "Error from approximate probabilistic inference is tolerable in many AI applications. But it is undesirable to have inference errors corrupting results in socially impactful applications of AI, such as automated decision-making, and especially in fairness analysis.\n",
      "Jean-Baptiste Tristan, associate professor at Boston College and former research scientist at Oracle Labs, who was not involved in the new research, says, \"I've worked on fairness analysis in academia and in real-world, large-scale industry settings. SPPL offers improved flexibility and trustworthiness over other PPLs on this challenging and important class of problems due to the expressiveness of the language, its precise and simple semantics, and the speed and soundness of the exact symbolic inference engine.\"\n",
      "SPPL avoids errors by restricting to a carefully designed class of models that still includes a broad class of AI algorithms, including the decision tree classifiers that are widely used for algorithmic decision-making. SPPL works by compiling probabilistic programs into a specialized data structure called a \"sum-product expression.\" SPPL further builds on the emerging theme of using probabilistic circuits as a representation that enables efficient probabilistic inference. This approach extends prior work on sum-product networks to models and queries expressed via a probabilistic programming language. However, Saad notes that this approach comes with limitations: “SPPL is substantially faster for analyzing the fairness of a decision tree, for example, but it can't analyze models like neural networks. Other systems can analyze both neural networks and decision trees, but they tend to be slower and give inexact answers.\"\n",
      "\"SPPL shows that exact probabilistic inference is practical, not just theoretically possible, for a broad class of probabilistic programs,\" says Vikash Mansinghka, an MIT principal research scientist and senior author on the paper. \"In my lab, we've seen symbolic inference driving speed and accuracy improvements in other inference tasks that we previously approached via approximate Monte Carlo and deep learning algorithms. We've also been applying SPPL to probabilistic programs learned from real-world databases, to quantify the probability of rare events, generate synthetic proxy data given constraints, and automatically screen data for probable anomalies.”\n",
      "The new SPPL probabilistic programming language was presented in June at the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), in a paper that Saad co-authored with MIT EECS Professor Martin Rinard and Mansinghka. SPPL is implemented in Python and is available open source.\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past 50 years, mechanical engineering students at MIT have convened on campus for a boisterous robot competition. Since the 1970s, when the late Professor Emeritus Woodie Flowers first challenged students to build a machine using a “kit of junk,” students in class 2.007 (Design and Manufacturing I) have designed and built their own robots to compete in the class’s final robot competition. For many students, the class and competition are a driving factor in their decision to enroll in MIT.\n",
      "“Each year, students tell us that they came to MIT specifically to take 2.007 and participate in the mayhem of creating these robots and doing this fun competition,” says Amos Winter, associate professor of mechanical engineering and 2.007 co-lead instructor.\n",
      "This was the case for Julianna Rodriguez, a rising senior studying mechanical engineering. “For me, 2.007 was the class I’ve been most looking forward to at MIT. It serves as a bridge between the technical classes I’ve taken and actually being able to build something tangible,” says Rodriguez.\n",
      "As with many hands-on classes, in March 2020 the faculty and teaching staff of 2.007 had to scrap plans for in-person elements, including the iconic final robot competition. While the team quickly pivoted to a version of the class focused on computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis, many, including Winter, were left heartbroken that students weren’t able to build and compete with their robot as they had hoped.\n",
      "“I really felt that students lost out on that physical connection to mechanical engineering that comes from hands-on work. They didn’t learn all those important lessons of building something in the real world, having it fail, then figuring out how to fix it,” says Winter.\n",
      "Winter and 2.007 co-lead instructor, Sangbae Kim, professor of mechanical engineering, immediately started envisioning what 2.007 might look like in spring 2021.\n",
      "“As an educator, it was such a great learning opportunity. The challenges forced us to think differently and be more creative,” adds Kim.\n",
      "Knowing there would be many challenges associated with giving students the hands-on, confidence-building experience 2.007 usually provides, Winter led an effort to re-imagine the class and account for any eventuality. He secured resources from MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, including hiring Antoni Soledad ’21, who participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) under Winter’s guidance. Winter took the fall semester off from teaching so he could focus on developing an entirely new 2.007 curriculum that maintained the class’s core tenets, including how the team could pull off a live, head-to-head, remote robot competition.\n",
      "A 130-pound delivery\n",
      "The team developed a list of “must haves” when brainstorming how to re-envision 2.007. First and foremost was retaining the confidence-building element of students coming up with their own design and building it with their own two hands, while at the same time learning core mechanical engineering principles.\n",
      "“It was critical for this year's class for us to provide all the magic and deep engineering learning that comes from our normal hands-on experience, but do it in a remote environment,” adds Winter.\n",
      "Central to all the teaching staff’s goals was equity. With some students likely participating fully remotely, the teaching team had to come up with solutions that were fair to everyone, whether they lived in a dorm, apartment, or across the country in their family’s home.\n",
      "The team’s solution was to send a kit of materials to all 130 students in the class. The first generation of the kit was developed last summer by Soledad. By fall, Winter and Soledad were joined by teaching assistant Georgia Van de Zande and four other UROPs to continue iterating the kit.\n",
      "“Because the students couldn’t come to the Pappalardo lab, we decided to send the Pappalardo lab to them,” says Van de Zande.\n",

      "The team put a great deal of thought into the size, weight, and composition of these “Pappalardo-in-a-Box” kits. The result was a 130-pound kit filled with tools and materials students could use to build their own robots from home throughout the semester. There was enough variety in the materials to ensure each student could come up with their own creative and unique design.\n",
      "“It’s really exciting that these students are starting their mechanical engineering journey with a literal toolbox full of tools they will use throughout their careers,” adds Van de Zande.\n",
      "The team also identified a fitting theme for this year’s competition: “Home Alone: Together.” The theme was a nod to the classic holiday movie and the fact that students would be designing, building, and competing primarily from their homes throughout the semester. \n",
      "A hybrid semester\n",
      "With the kits delivered to students, Winter, Kim, and their team focused on how to actually teach students core design and manufacturing principles, regardless of where they were located.\n",
      "All formal lab exercises were done virtually. Students would often meet one-on-one with instructors and lab staff via Zoom. This remote setup actually increased the amount of individual attention each student received from staff.  \n",
      "“In so many instances, virtual has been better than our normal format,” says Winter. “We have really meaningful one-on-one meetings with the students during our lab sections, because there's no distractions like there would be in the physical lab.”\n",
      "The class also featured an optional in-person element open to students who had access to campus. Those students would visit the Pappalardo lab in small groups to interact with lab staff. The Pappalardo shop staff set up socially distanced workstations where students could safely work in the lab and get staff feedback. These workstations featured the exact same tools and materials every student had at home. The staff made sure they were just as accessible via Zoom to the students who could not come to campus.\n",

These videos demonstrated common elements in robotic design and the nuances at play in fabrication and assembly. The demos proved to be crucial in deepening students’ understanding of mechanism design; this was reflected in the quality and reliability of the robots they produced for the final competition.\n",
      "The individual attention and dedication the 2.007 teaching team showed throughout the semester had a tangible impact on students.\n",
      "“In my honest opinion, the 2.007 staff has been one of the most nurturing and understanding faculty that I've ever encountered,” says Megan Ngo, a rising junior studying mechanical engineering. “I’ve learned so much: the physics behind making a part, how to start a project from start to finish and just how cool mechanical engineering can be in the real world.”\n",
      "MIT’s first-ever virtual robot competition\n",
      "Students put the skills they learned throughout the semester to the test. Armed with their unique robot design, their own game board, and a camera, students were ready to participate in the first known live, head-to-head, remote physical robot competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The settings for the competition varied. Ben Owen Block and his roommate who also took the class organized the layout of their dorm room around the competition. Senior Julianna Rodriguez built her robot from an apartment in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. John Malloy started the semester in Colorado before moving home to Florida, where he built his robot in his childhood bedroom.\n",
      "Dressed as “Home Alone” villains Harry and Marv, Winter and Kim emceed the competition as students’ robots went head-to-head in a series of elimination rounds. While each robot competed from a different location, the two competitors per round ran at the same time with their video feeds mixed into a live webcast. Robots performed tasks on a game board, modeled after the booby-trapped McCallister house from the movie. The robot that earned the most points would survive onto the next round.\n",
      "In the end, Jordan Ambrosio’s robot emerged as the champion. But according to Winter, everyone was a winner this year.\n",
      "“To come out of this semester, see what the students accomplished, and know that the educational experience of the class has been retained, it feels triumphant,” says Winter.\n",
      "For Kim, a key improvement this year was the easy access students had to their robots. Rather than only work on their robots in the lab, students were able to tinker with their robots in their spare time.\n",
      "“We found that students could manage their time much better when they had their tools and materials right in their rooms,” says Kim.\n",
      "While the 2022 robot competition will hopefully be back in the Johnson Ice Rink, the 2.007 teaching team plans on incorporating many of the positive changes made in reaction to the pandemic to future semesters.\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a teenager, Kristy Johnson thought she had her career all planned out. Raised in a small town in Indiana, she spent much of her childhood stargazing and mapping constellations. She dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist and pursued a rigorous academic path. After achieving top honors as an undergraduate, Johnson immediately began a PhD program in physics at the University of Maryland.\n",
      "Everything changed when she discovered her son, Felix, had a rare genetic disorder, one with only seven known cases in the world. The condition is associated with delayed development, absent speech, severe intellectual disabilities, autism, epilepsy, and motor challenges.\n",
      "“We knew that this would be something that would affect him for his entire life, and therefore us as a family. I knew I wanted and needed to stay home with him instead of finishing my PhD,” says Johnson.\n",
      "Building a future for her son\n",
      "For the next five years, Johnson poured the dedication she had honed as a grad student into caring for her son. While in the evenings she edited scientific manuscripts and taught college astronomy to earn a living, her free time was spent learning everything she could about her son’s condition. Johnson studied genetics, neuroscience, and even taught herself American Sign Language as a new way to connect with him.\n",
      "Yet for Johnson, this wasn’t enough. Her son was still struggling to meet milestones. He showed intense interest in certain songs and music but was still not engaging or learning on his own. She realized that if the tools her son needed to succeed didn’t exist, she would have to make them herself. “I bought an Arduino and started programming things to react with his movements and encourage him to learn,” says Johnson. “Most of the things I built were out of cardboard, scraps of wood, and old toys. It was after I received a $300 grant from the Artisan’s Asylum, a makerspace in Somerville, that I was able to make my first real prototypes.”\n",
      "As her son grew older, Johnson began to consider returning to research. But so much of her purpose had changed. “I realized physics wasn’t the love of my life anymore — my son was. And I knew that I wanted to pursue research that would improve his life and the lives of people like him,” Johnson says.\n",
      "Her old resume, entirely physics-oriented, couldn’t begin to convey the countless hours she had spent studying neurodevelopmental disorders. In her search for a research program, she faced several rejections before finding the MIT Media Lab, which welcomes individuals with unique backgrounds and focuses on multidisciplinary research. “It’s like the academic island of misfit toys,” jokes Johnson. “I’m so grateful that it exists. I’ve never felt more at home anywhere in my entire life.” \n",
      "Designing devices to enhance communication and understanding \n",
      "Today, Johnson is a senior graduate student in the Picard Lab. She has led a variety of projects that support individuals with neurodevelopmental differences. Her work in the Affective Computing Group uses wearable devices that measure changes in the electrical properties of the skin. “These devices can be worn on the wrist and serve as a proxy for sympathetic nervous system responses,” she says.\n",
      "“Before, people like my son would often struggle to come into a clinical setting. With wearable devices, you can unobtrusively observe populations in their normal environments,” she says. Johnson has pursued neuroscience research that combines these wearable sensors with deep brain stimulation in epilepsy patients and fMRI neuroimaging with children with autism. “We’re really expanding our knowledge of what’s happening in the brain and how that relates to everyday life.”\n",
      "Johnson is also currently collaborating with MIT graduate student Jaya Narain as well as researchers at MIT Lincoln Lab and Harvard University on Commalla, a research project whose name combines “communication” and “all.” The team is working to capture, characterize, and classify nonverbal vocalizations from a population that she refers to as mv*. The term encompasses those with 20 or fewer spoken words, potentially due to genetic disorders, intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, and/or other neurological conditions.\n",
      "“Nonverbal vocalizations are sounds like ‘uh huh’ or ‘ahh’ that have an associated emotion or meaning. Their meanings have been studied in infants and many other species and animals,” says Johnson. “Yet, they have not been studied in mv* individuals, which is mind-blowing and frustrating to me. Not only does my son fall into this category, but so do over 1 million individuals in the U.S.”\n",
      "These nonverbal vocalizations can be recorded through the Commalla app and labeled with the correct meaning by a knowledgeable caretaker. All of this is done remotely, meaning the research has been able to continue throughout the global pandemic and to reach the geographically dispersed mv* community, Johnson says. The team then takes these recordings and has started to develop machine-learning models that help interpret an individual’s vocalizations in real time. The recordings can also be easily shared to help those who may be communicating with the individual for the first time. “Many mv* individuals are robustly communicating, but their listener is trained only for speech. We want to help them be heard and understood,” she says. “I’m hopeful that this project is something we can continue to expand and grow into the basis of a new field.”\n",
      "Johnson will defend her PhD next week and recently accepted a postdoc at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she will continue research in translational neuroscience for children with neurodevelopmental disorders or differences. She hopes her research will deepen our understanding of communication from all individuals and empower mv* individuals, including her son, to be seen for all they can do.\n",
      "“Just as in astronomy, we must study our brains indirectly to begin to unravel their complexity,” says Johnson. “Brains are a human cosmos, filled with so much that we recognize as beautiful but have yet to understand.”\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Guang Cui and Daniel Sun are members of the class of 2022, course 6.3 (Computer Science and Engineering) majors, former roommates, best friends — and now, alumni of the long-running TV competition “American Ninja Warrior.” The episode in which they debuted (season 13, night 4 of qualifiers) as first-time competitors recently aired on NBC, and is available on several streaming services. They spoke recently about what it takes to be a ninja. \n",
      "Q: How did you decide to try for this goal — were you both already fans of “American Ninja Warrior”? \n",
      "Dan: Guang and I met in CPW [Campus Preview Weekend] and bonded almost immediately. We shared lots of things in common, and one of them was watching “American Ninja Warrior,” or ANW, since we were kids. When we met, we were both 18 and thought, “Wouldn’t it be cool if we tried to be on the show?” But the lower age limit to apply was 21. We spent our freshman year together in Chicago, participating in an internship at Akuna Capital. While we were there, we picked up bouldering as a pastime. A lot of the skills involved in bouldering are transferable to ANW, so when they lowered the age restriction for application from 21 to 18, we decided we should apply. We applied in 2019 for the 2020 season and were rejected, but we tried again the next year and ended up on the show.\n",
      "Guang: Personally, I remember being about 5 years old, in the lobby of my apartment building, watching the original Japanese version of the show, “Sasuke.” We all watched ANW growing up, so when Dan and I met in freshman year and immediately had conversations about all the big-name ninjas and who we thought was the best, I knew we were going to be close.\n",
      "Dan: My parents would always chastise me for climbing on things in the house, trying to do random tricks — a big one was doing pull-ups on door frames. My parents would always be upset, thinking I was going to break the door frames, but now I see that as me getting started with the training relatively early.\n",
      "Guang: It was the same with me, though I don’t think I could do pull-ups on the door frames until high school. But I could do spider climbs on door frames starting when I was about 9 years old, and, like Dan’s, my parents would get mad at me.\n",
      "Q: Athletic training during any Boston winter is hard — but it must have been doubly so during Covid. How did you stay safe while you trained? \n",
      "Dan: During the early days we were both at home, and very early on we realized that there was really no way to safely go to the gym. The first thing I ordered was a pull-up bar so I could do exercises like calisthenics and body weight stuff. Trying to come up with exercises we could do was challenging.\n",
      "Guang: At home, I also did a lot of calisthenics and other random exercises using makeshift materials. I made a random YouTube video of me working out and doing ninja stuff at home. Once we were allowed to attend socially distanced gyms, I went to the rock-climbing gym with my mask on. I got tested a lot in the late summer. We kept each other updated with training; I would text Dan the hard rock-climbing problems I encountered. In spring, when we got back onto campus, that’s when we got the surprise call that we would be on the show. After that, we would go to the ninja gym multiple times every week, as well as training in the Z Center. We would get a Zipcar and go to the ninja gyms out in Boston and Wellesley, train for two hours in the evening, then get home and rest. We blew through a thousand dollars in Zipcar costs … but it was absolutely worth it.\n",
      "Q: What’s it like to go behind the scenes of the set — were there any surprises?\n",
      "Dan: One memory that comes to mind is when we were on the buses to go to the actual competition. I didn’t know any of the ninjas that were there on my bus, and then this one guy in a hoodie and beanie, sipping tea, sits down next to me. He starts talking to the guy behind me about the obstacles, like, “What do you think we’re gonna have?” And I leaned in to join the conversation. As I’m introducing myself, the guy pulls back his hoodie — and it’s David Campbell, the “Godfather,” who has competed in literally every ANW competition. I’ve seen him in every season since I was a little kid. He gave me a bunch of advice for being in my rookie season. It’s surreal to see people you’ve just seen on TV, and I’ll say that I really like the people in the ninja community — they’re really friendly and open to talking, and they lead interesting lives.\n",
      "Guang: I totally agree. Interacting with people whom we’ve seen as celebrities for so long is crazy. To realize that we’re running the same course is still wild to me. We were playing instruments in the office there, and [retired NFL player] Andrew East walked by and said, “You sound nice!” There are people from all walks of life who participate, and since we’re normally surrounded by other college students, it was great to have the opportunity to learn from them.\n",
      "Q: When did you learn which challenges you’d be facing, and how did you mentally prepare? Emotionally?\n",
      "Guang: You don’t learn the obstacles until the day of filming; it was like maybe an hour or two, max, before we ran the course. They took us through and told us the rules, and then we were just thinking about how to go through, engaging in mental visualization and strategizing.\n",
      "The only exception to the surprises are the first and last obstacle, which are usually the same. The last obstacle is always the Warped Wall, so we’d practice that a lot. Recently, the first obstacle has been the wobble steps, followed a rope to the platform. I was weirdly really nervous about the first obstacle! The day before we had to leave for Seattle, I put five books in the hallway and strode across them just to prepare; Dan came out and laughed at me. I was being dumb, but it was good practice.\n",
      "Q: Tell us about the actual, physical experience of going through the course.\n",
      "Guang: I would say it obviously creates a lot of nerves, because you only get to do it once a year. I took a lot of deep breaths and tried to zone in, and live in the moment. Physically, I think my training helped a lot; I didn’t feel too tired after any one obstacle. It’s like riding a roller coaster but a lot better. In the moment, it’s just so fun — it’s like play.\n",
      "Dan: I remember that backstage, in the warm-up area, there were these bars for infrastructure to hold up some posters, and the other ninjas were doing pull-ups and warmups on those bars. They’d set up some crash pads, so after we got a glimpse of the obstacles, we were trying to mimic them by swinging around on the support bars.\n",
      "Q: Do you think being a scientist is beneficial to being a ninja — and if so, how?\n",
      "Dan: There’s definitely things that carry over; the discipline and training it takes to be a ninja is very similar to discipline in studying. Like achieving anything in life, you have to put in the hours, effort, and training, to get to where you want to be. You have to eat healthy and work on your body in order to be at peak performance. Mental preparation translates well, too; we both did a lot of academic competitions back in high school, and a lot of that mindset translates. You have to be completely zoned in and focused on the question at hand in order to make progress on the problem. That “in the zone” feeling is very similar across both kinds of challenge.\n",
      "Guang: One area where the experience doesn’t translate is when the announcers say things like “as scientists, you should be able to calculate the trajectory of the needed movement” … well, no. There are a few cases where knowing the physics of an obstacle can sort of help — for instance, knowing that if you spread your legs out, you have a greater chance of completing the obstacle. But the actual experience of being on the obstacle helps way more. I’m glad we had the opportunity to do this challenge that is totally different than either computer science or electrical engineering. It’s nice to play on obstacles when I’m burnt out from writing code. It balances my life.\n",
      "Q: How has this experience changed you?  \n",
      "Dan: The first thing both of us said after it was over was, “We have to run it back next year; we’ll be back.” Surface-level, it was cool to learn about how TV is made. We realized a lot of things can be scripted or filmed hundreds of times until they get it right. Additionally, it was a great learning experience for figuring out how I act in high-pressure scenarios — “American Ninja Warrior” was by far the biggest stage I’ve ever been on, which is kind of bizarre because I feel like I have other strengths as well, and I would have expected to be showcasing those! It’s not that Ninja is my weakest side, exactly, but it was cool to be able to showcase that athletic side of myself on the biggest stage.\n",
      "Guang: I learned a little about what I was capable of. If you’d asked me three years ago if I would be on the show, I would have been pretty surprised. As Dan said, we would have been less surprised if we’d done something remarkable in the sciences. I don’t think the experience fundamentally changed us as people; we had this one moment on TV. It’s just a neat moment in our lives. Also, Dan and I were best friends before ANW, but this experience has brought us even closer, which was really great.  \n",
      "Q: Do you plan to try to start a ninja community at MIT?  \n",
      "Guang: Actually, yes! We’ve been talking about trying to get a ANW club started, apply through MIT and maybe make it official soon.\n",

      " TITLE : A new approach to preventing human-induced earthquakes \n",
      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When humans pump large volumes of fluid into the ground, they can set off potentially damaging earthquakes, depending on the underlying geology. This has been the case in certain oil- and gas-producing regions, where wastewater, often mixed with oil, is disposed of by injecting it back into the ground — a process that has triggered sizable seismic events in recent years.\n",
      "Now MIT researchers, working with an interdisciplinary team of scientists from industry and academia, have developed a method to manage such human-induced seismicity, and have demonstrated that the technique successfully reduced the number of earthquakes occurring in an active oil field.\n",
      "Their results, appearing today in Nature, could help mitigate earthquakes caused by the oil and gas industry, not just from the injection of wastewater produced with oil, but also that produced from hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” The team’s approach could also help prevent quakes from other human activities, such as the filling of water reservoirs and aquifers, and the sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep geologic formations.\n",
      "“Triggered seismicity is a problem that goes way beyond producing oil,” says study lead author Bradford Hager, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth Sciences in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “This is a huge problem for society that will have to be confronted if we are to safely inject carbon dioxide into the subsurface. We demonstrated the kind of study that will be necessary for doing this.”\n",
      "The study’s co-authors include Ruben Juanes, professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT, and collaborators from the University of California at Riverside, the University of Texas at Austin, Harvard University, and Eni, a multinational oil and gas company based in Italy.\n",
      "Safe injections\n",
      "Both natural and human-induced earthquakes occur along geologic faults, or fractures between two blocks of rock in the Earth’s crust. In stable periods, the rocks on either side of a fault are held in place by the pressures generated by surrounding rocks. But when a large volume of fluid is suddenly injected at high rates, it can upset a fault’s fluid stress balance. In some cases, this sudden injection can lubricate a fault and cause rocks on either side to slip and trigger an earthquake.\n",
      "The most common source of such fluid injections is from the oil and gas industry’s disposal of wastewater that is brought up along with oil. Field operators dispose of this water through injection wells that continuously pump the water back into the ground at high pressures.\n",
      "“There’s a lot of water produced with the oil, and that water is injected into the ground, which has caused a large number of quakes,” Hager notes. “So, for a while, oil-producing regions in Oklahoma had more magnitude 3 quakes than California, because of all this wastewater that was being injected.”\n",
      "In recent years, a similar problem arose in southern Italy, where injection wells on oil fields operated by Eni triggered microseisms in an area where large naturally occurring earthquakes had previously occurred. The company, looking for ways to address the problem, sought consulation from Hager and Juanes, both leading experts in seismicity and subsurface flows.\n",
      "“This was an opportunity for us to get access to high-quality seismic data about the subsurface, and learn how to do these injections safely,” Juanes says.\n",
      "Seismic blueprint\n",
      "The team made use of detailed information, accumulated by the oil company over years of operation in the Val D’Agri oil field, a region of southern Italy that lies in a tectonically active basin. The data included information about the region’s earthquake record, dating back to the 1600s, as well as the structure of rocks and faults, and the state of the subsurface corresponding to the various injection rates of each well.\n",

      "\n",
      "The researchers integrated these data into a coupled subsurface flow and geomechanical model, which predicts how the stresses and strains of underground structures evolve as the volume of pore fluid, such as from the injection of water, changes. They connected this model to an earthquake mechanics model in order to translate the changes in underground stress and fluid pressure into a likelihood of triggering earthquakes. They then quantified the rate of earthquakes associated with various rates of water injection, and identified scenarios that were unlikely to trigger large quakes.\n",
      "When they ran the models using data from 1993 through 2016, the predictions of seismic activity matched with the earthquake record during this period, validating their approach. They then ran the models forward in time, through the year 2025, to predict the region’s seismic response to three different injection rates: 2,000, 2,500, and 3,000 cubic meters per day. The simulations showed that large earthquakes could be avoided if operators kept injection rates at 2,000 cubic meters per day — a flow rate comparable to a small public fire hydrant.\n",
      "Eni field operators implemented the team’s recommended rate at the oil field’s single water injection well over a 30-month period between January 2017 and June 2019. In this time, the team observed only a few tiny seismic events, which coincided with brief periods when operators went above the recommended injection rate.\n",
      "“The seismicity in the region has been very low in these two-and-a-half years, with around four quakes of 0.5 magnitude, as opposed to hundreds of quakes, of up to 3 magnitude, that were happening between 2006 and 2016,” Hager says. \n",
      "The results demonstrate that operators can successfully manage earthquakes by adjusting injection rates, based on the underlying geology. Juanes says the team’s modeling approach may help to prevent earthquakes related to other processes, such as the building of water reservoirs and the sequestration of carbon dioxide — as long as there is detailed information about a region’s subsurface.\n",
      "“A lot of effort needs to go into understanding the geologic setting,” says Juanes, who notes that, if carbon sequestration were carried out on depleted oil fields, “such reservoirs could have this type of history, seismic information, and geologic interpretation that you could use to build similar models for carbon sequestration. We show it’s at least possible to manage seismicity in an operational setting. And we offer a blueprint for how to do it.”\n",
      "This research was supported, in part, by Eni.\n",

      "\n",
      "Eesha Khare has always seen a world of matter. The daughter of a hardware engineer and a biologist, she has an insatiable interest in what substances — both synthetic and biological — have in common. Not surprisingly, that perspective led her to the study of materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recognized early on that everything around me is a material,” she says. “How our phones respond to touches, how trees in nature to give us both structural wood and foldable paper, or how we are able to make high skyscrapers with steel and glass, it all comes down to the fundamentals: This is materials science and engineering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rising fourth-year PhD student in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), Khare now studies the metal-coordination bonds that allow mussels to bind to rocks along turbulent coastlines. But Khare’s scientific enthusiasm has also led to expansive interests from science policy to climate advocacy and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "A material world\n",
      "\n",
      "A Silicon Valley native, Khare recalls vividly how excited she was about science as a young girl, both at school and at myriad science fairs and high school laboratory internships. One such internship at the University of California at Santa Cruz introduced her to the study of nanomaterials, or materials that are smaller than a single human cell. The project piqued her interest in how research could lead to energy-storage applications, and she began to ponder the connections between materials, science policy, and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an undergraduate at Harvard University, Khare pursued a degree in engineering sciences and chemistry while also working at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. There, she grew fascinated by environmental advocacy in the policy space, working for then-professor Gina McCarthy, who is currently serving in the Biden administration as the first-ever White House climate advisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following her academic explorations in college, Khare wanted to consider science in a new light before pursuing her doctorate in materials science and engineering. She deferred her program acceptance at MIT in order to attend Cambridge University in the U.K., where she earned a master’s degree in the history and philosophy of science. “Especially in a PhD program, it can often feel like your head is deep in the science as you push new research frontiers, but I wanted take a step back and be inspired by how scientists in the past made their discoveries,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her experience at Cambridge was both challenging and informative, but Khare quickly found that her mechanistic curiosity remained persistent — a realization that came in the form of a biological material.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My very first master’s research project was about environmental pollution indicators in the U.K., and I was looking specifically at lichen to understand the social and political reasons why they were adopted by the public as pollution indicators,” Khare explains. “But I found myself wondering more about how lichen can act as pollution indicators. And I found that to be quite similar for most of my research projects: I was more interested in how the technology or discovery actually worked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Enthusiasm for innovation\n",
      "\n",
      "Fittingly, these bioindicators confirmed for her that studying materials at MIT was the right course. Now Khare works on a different organism altogether, conducting research on the metal-coordination chemical interactions of a biopolymer secreted by mussels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mussels secrete this thread and can adhere to ocean walls. So, when ocean waves come, mussels don’t get dislodged that easily,” Khare says. “This is partly because of how metal ions in this material bind to different amino acids in the protein. There’s no input from the mussel itself to control anything there; all the magic is in this biological material that is not only very sticky, but also doesn’t break very readily, and if you cut it, it can re-heal that interface as well! If we could better understand and replicate this biological material in our own world, we could have materials self-heal and never break and thus eliminate so much waste.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To study this natural material, Khare combines computational and experimental techniques, experimentally synthesizing her own biopolymers and studying their properties with in silico molecular dynamics. Her co-advisors — Markus Buehler, the Jerry McAfee Professor of Engineering in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Niels Holten-Andersen, professor of materials science and engineering — have embraced this dual-approach to her project, as well as her abundant enthusiasm for innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khare likes to take one exploratory course per semester, and a recent offering in the MIT Sloan School of Management inspired her to pursue entrepreneurship. These days she is spending much of her free time on a startup called Taxie, formed with fellow MIT students after taking the course 15.390 (New Enterprises). Taxie attempts to electrify the rideshare business by making electric rental cars available to rideshare drivers. Khare hopes this project will initiate some small first steps in making the ridesharing industry environmentally cleaner — and in democratizing access to electric vehicles for rideshare drivers, who often hail from lower-income or immigrant backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are a lot of goals thrown around for reducing emissions or helping our environment. But we are slowly getting physical things on the road, physical things to real people, and I like to think that we are helping to accelerate the electric transition,” Khare says. “These small steps are helpful for learning, at the very least, how we can make a transition to electric or to a cleaner industry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside her startup work, Khare has pursued a number of other extracurricular activities at MIT, including co-organizing her department’s Student Application Assistance Program and serving on DMSE’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council. Her varied interests also have led to a diverse group of friends, which suits her well, because she is a self-described “people-person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a year where maintaining connections has been more challenging than usual, Khare has focused on the positive, spending her spring semester with family in California and practicing Bharatanatyam, a form of Indian classical dance, over Zoom. As she looks to the future, Khare hopes to bring even more of her interests together, like materials science and climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to understand the energy and environmental sector at large to identify the most pressing technology gaps and how can I use my knowledge to contribute. My goal is to figure out where can I personally make a difference and where it can have a bigger impact to help our climate,” she says. “I like being outside of my comfort zone.”\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, we live in a richly connected world, facilitating not only the efficient spread of a virus but also of information and influence. What can we learn by analyzing these connections? This is a core question of network science, a field of research that models interactions across physical, biological, social, and information systems to solve problems.\n",
      "The 2021 Graph Exploitation Symposium (GraphEx), hosted by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, brought together top network science researchers to share the latest advances and applications in the field.\n",
      "\"We explore and identify how exploitation of graph data can offer key technology enablers to solve the most pressing problems our nation faces today,\" says Edward Kao, a symposium organizer and technical staff in Lincoln Laboratory's AI Software Architectures and Algorithms Group.\n",
      "The themes of the virtual event revolved around some of the year's most relevant issues, such as analyzing disinformation on social media, modeling the pandemic's spread, and using graph-based machine learning models to speed drug design.\n",
      "\"The special sessions on influence operations and Covid-19 at GraphEx reflect the relevance of network and graph-based analysis for understanding the phenomenology of these complicated and impactful aspects of modern-day life, and also may suggest paths forward as we learn more and more about graph manipulation,\" says William Streilein, who co-chaired the event with Rajmonda Caceres, both of Lincoln Laboratory.\n",
      "Social networks\n",
      "Several presentations at the symposium focused on the role of network science in analyzing influence operations (IO), or organized attempts by state and/or non-state actors to spread disinformation narratives.  \n",
      "Lincoln Laboratory researchers have been developing tools to classify and quantify the influence of social media accounts that are likely IO accounts, such as those willfully spreading false Covid-19 treatments to vulnerable populations.\n",
      "\"A cluster of IO accounts acts as an echo chamber to amplify the narrative. The vulnerable population is then engaging in these narratives,\" says Erika Mackin, a researcher developing the tool, called RIO or Reconnaissance of Influence Operations.\n",
      "To classify IO accounts, Mackin and her team trained an algorithm to detect probable IO accounts in Twitter networks based on a specific hashtag or narrative. One example they studied was #MacronLeaks, a disinformation campaign targeting Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 French presidential election. The algorithm is trained to label accounts within this network as being IO on the basis of several factors, such as the number of interactions with foreign news accounts, the number of links tweeted, or number of languages used. Their model then uses a statistical approach to score an account's level of influence in spreading the narrative within that network.\n",
      "The team has found that their classifier outperforms existing detectors of IO accounts, because it can identify both bot accounts and human-operated ones. They've also discovered that IO accounts that pushed the 2017 French election disinformation narrative largely overlap with accounts influentially spreading Covid-19 pandemic disinformation today. \"This suggests that these accounts will continue to transition to disinformation narratives,\" Mackin says.\n",
      "Pandemic modeling\n",
      "Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, leaders have been looking to epidemiological models, which predict how disease will spread, to make sound decisions. Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, has been leading Covid-19 modeling efforts in the United States, and shared a keynote on this work at the symposium.\n",
      "Besides taking into account the biological facts of the disease, such as its incubation period, Vespignani's model is especially powerful in its inclusion of community behavior. To run realistic simulations of disease spread, he develops \"synthetic populations\" that are built by using publicly available, highly detailed datasets about U.S. households. \"We create a population that is not real, but is statistically real, and generate a map of the interactions of those individuals,\" he says. This information feeds back into the model to predict the spread of the disease. \n",
      "Today, Vespignani is considering how to integrate genomic analysis of the virus into this kind of population modeling in order to understand how variants are spreading. \"It's still a work in progress that is extremely interesting,\" he says, adding that this approach has been useful in modeling the dispersal of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. \n",
      "As researchers model the virus' spread, Lucas Laird at Lincoln Laboratory is considering how network science can be used to design effective control strategies. He and his team are developing a model for customizing strategies for different geographic regions. The effort was spurred by the differences in Covid-19 spread across U.S. communities, and what the researchers found to be a gap in intervention modeling to address those differences.\n",
      "As examples, they applied their planning algorithm to three counties in Florida, Massachusetts, and California. Taking into account the characteristics of a specific geographic center, such as the number of susceptible individuals and number of infections there, their planner institutes different strategies in those communities throughout the outbreak duration.\n",
      "\"Our approach eradicates disease in 100 days, but it also is able to do it with much more targeted interventions than any of the global interventions. In other words, you don't have to shut down a full country.\" Laird adds that their planner offers a \"sandbox environment\" for exploring intervention strategies in the future.\n",
      "Machine learning with graphs\n",
      "Graph-based machine learning is receiving increasing attention for its potential to \"learn\" the complex relationships between graphical data, and thus extract new insights or predictions about these relationships. This interest has given rise to a new class of algorithms called graph neural networks. Today, graph neural networks are being applied in areas such as drug discovery and material design, with promising results.\n",
      "\"We can now apply deep learning much more broadly, not only to medical images and biological sequences. This creates new opportunities in data-rich biology and medicine,\" says Marinka Zitnik, an assistant professor at Harvard University who presented her research at GraphEx.\n",
      "Zitnik's research focuses on the rich networks of interactions between proteins, drugs, disease, and patients, at the scale of billions of interactions. One application of this research is discovering drugs to treat diseases with no or few approved drug treatments, such as for Covid-19. In April, Zitnik's team published a paper on their research that used graph neural networks to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, identifying four that could be repurposed to treat Covid-19.\n",
      "At Lincoln Laboratory, researchers are similarly applying graph neural networks to the challenge of designing advanced materials, such as those that can withstand extreme radiation or capture carbon dioxide. Like the process of designing drugs, the trial-and-error approach to materials design is time-consuming and costly. The laboratory's team is developing graph neural networks that can learn relationships between a material’s crystalline structure and its properties. This network can then be used to predict a variety of properties from any new crystal structure, greatly speeding up the process of screening materials with desired properties for specific applications.\n",
      "\"Graph representation learning has emerged as a rich and thriving research area for incorporating inductive bias and structured priors during the machine learning process, with broad applications such as drug design, accelerated scientific discovery, and personalized recommendation systems,\" Caceres says. \n",
      "A vibrant community \n",
      "Lincoln Laboratory has hosted the GraphEx Symposium annually since 2010, with the exception of last year's cancellation due to Covid-19. \"One key takeaway is that despite the postponement from last year and the need to be virtual, the GraphEx community is as vibrant and active as it's ever been,\" Streilein says. \"Network-based analysis continues to expand its reach and is applied to ever-more important areas of science, society, and defense with increasing impact.\"\n",
      "In addition to those from Lincoln Laboratory, technical committee members and co-chairs of the GraphEx Symposium included researchers from Harvard University, Arizona State University, Stanford University, Smith College, Duke University, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Sandia National Laboratories.\n",

      "\n",
      " BODY :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To create high-resolution, 3D images of tissues such as the brain, researchers often use two-photon microscopy, which involves aiming a high-intensity laser at the specimen to induce fluorescence excitation. However, scanning deep within the brain can be difficult because light scatters off of tissues as it goes deeper, making images blurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-photon imaging is also time-consuming, as it usually requires scanning individual pixels one at a time. A team of MIT and Harvard University researchers has now developed a modified version of two-photon imaging that can image deeper within tissue and perform the imaging much more quickly than what was previously possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of imaging could allow scientists to more rapidly obtain high-resolution images of structures such as blood vessels and individual neurons within the brain, the researchers say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By modifying the laser beam coming into the tissue, we showed that we can go deeper and we can do finer imaging than the previous techniques,” says Murat Yildirim, an MIT research scientist and one of the authors of the new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIT graduate student Cheng Zheng and former postdoc Jong Kang Park are the lead authors of the paper, which appears today in Science Advances. Dushan N. Wadduwage, a former MIT postdoc who is now a John Harvard Distinguished Science Fellow in Imaging at the Center for Advanced Imaging at Harvard University, is the paper’s senior author. Other authors include Josiah Boivin, an MIT postdoc; Yi Xue, a former MIT graduate student; Mriganka Sur, the Newton Professor of Neuroscience at MIT; and Peter So, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering and of biological engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep imaging\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-photon microscopy works by shining an intense beam of near-infrared light onto a single point within a sample, inducing simultaneous absorption of two photons at the focal point, where the intensity is the highest. This long-wavelength, low-energy light can penetrate deeper into tissue without damaging it, allowing for imaging below the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, two-photon excitation generates images by fluorescence, and the fluorescent signal is in the visible spectral region. When imaging deeper into tissue samples, the fluorescent light scatters more and the image becomes blurry. Imaging many layers of tissue is also very time-consuming. Using wide-field imaging, in which an entire plane of tissue is illuminated at once, can speed up the process, but the resolution of this approach is not as great as that of point-by-point scanning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MIT team wanted to develop a method that would allow them to image a large tissue sample all at once, while still maintaining the high resolution of point-by-point scanning. To achieve that, they came up with a way to manipulate the light that they shine onto the sample. They use a form of wide-field microscopy, shining a plane of light onto the tissue, but modify the amplitude of the light so that they can turn each pixel on or off at different times. Some pixels are lit up while nearby pixels remain dark, and this predesigned pattern can be detected in the light scattered by the tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can turn each pixel on or off by this kind of modulation,” Zheng says. “If we turn off some of the spots, that creates space around each pixel, so now we can know what is happening in each of the individual spots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After the researchers obtain the raw images, they reconstruct each pixel using a computer algorithm that they created.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We control the shape of the light and we get the response from the tissue. From these responses, we try to resolve what kind of scattering the tissue has. As we do the reconstructions from our raw images, we can get a lot of information that you cannot see in the raw images,” Yildirim says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this technique, the researchers showed that they could image about 200 microns deep into slices of muscle and kidney tissue, and about 300 microns into the brains of mice. That is about twice as deep as was possible without this patterned excitation and computational reconstruction, Yildirim says. The technique can also generate images about 100 to 1,000 times faster than conventional two-photon microscopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brain structure\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of imaging should allow researchers to more rapidly obtain high-resolution images of neurons in the brain, as well as other structures such as blood vessels. Imaging blood vessels in the brains of mice could be particularly useful for learning more about how blood flow is affected by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Yildirim says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the studies of blood flow or morphology of the blood vessel structures are based on two-photon or three-photon point scanning systems, so they're slow,” he says. “By using this technology, we can really perform high-speed volumetric imaging of blood flow and blood vessel structure in order to understand the changes in blood flow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The technique could also lend itself to measuring neuronal activity, by adding voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes or fluorescent calcium probes that light up when neurons are excited. It could also be useful for analyzing other types of tissue, including tumors, where it could be used to help determine the edges of a tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering P41 program and the NIBIB Pathway to Independence Award, the Hamamatsu Corporation, the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), the Center for Advanced Imaging at Harvard University, and the John Harvard Distinguished Science Fellowship Program.\n",
