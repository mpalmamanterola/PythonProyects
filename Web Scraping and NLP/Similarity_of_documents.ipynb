       "'\\n\\n\\nelectronic health records have been widely adopted with the hope they would save time and improve the quality of patient care. but due to fragmented interfaces and tedious data entry procedures, physicians often spend more time navigating these systems than they do interacting with patients.\\n\\nresearchers at mit and the beth israel deaconess medical center are combining machine learning and human-computer interaction to create a better electronic health record (ehr). they developed medknowts, a system that unifies the processes of looking up medical records and documenting patient information into a single, interactive interface.\\n\\ndriven by artificial intelligence, this “smart” ehr automatically displays customized, patient-specific medical records when a clinician needs them. medknowts also provides autocomplete for clinical terms and auto-populates fields with patient information to help doctors work more efficiently.\\n\\n“in the origins of ehrs, there was this tremendous enthusiasm that getting all this information organized would be helpful to be able to track billing records, report statistics to the government, and provide data for scientific research. but few stopped to ask the deep questions around whether they would be of use for the clinician. i think a lot of clinicians feel they have had this burden of ehrs put on them for the benefit of bureaucracies and scientists and accountants. we came into this project asking how ehrs might actually benefit clinicians,” says david karger, professor of computer science in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory (csail) and senior author of the paper.\\n\\nthe research was co-authored by csail graduate students luke murray, who is the lead author, divya gopinath, and monica agrawal. other authors include steven horng, an emergency medicine attending physician and clinical lead for machine learning at the center for healthcare delivery science of beth israel deaconess medical center, and david sontag, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit and a member of csail and the institute for medical engineering and science. it will be presented at the association for computing machinery symposium on user interface software and technology next month.\\n\\na problem-oriented tool\\n\\nto design an ehr that would benefit doctors, the researchers had to think like doctors.\\n\\nthey created a note-taking editor with a side panel that displays relevant information from the patient’s medical history. that historical information appears in the form of cards that are focused on particular problems or concepts.\\n\\nfor instance, if medknowts identifies the clinical term “diabetes” in the text as a clinician types, the system automatically displays a “diabetes card” containing medications, lab values, and snippets from past records that are relevant to diabetes treatment.\\n\\nmost ehrs store historical information on separate pages and list medications or lab values alphabetically or chronologically, forcing the clinician to search through data to find the information they need, murray says. medknowts only displays information relevant to the particular concept the clinician is writing about.\\n\\n“this is a closer match to the way doctors think about information. a lot of times, doctors will do this subconsciously. they will look through a medications page and only focus on the medications that are relevant to the current conditions. we are helping to do that process automatically and hopefully move some things out of the doctor’s head so they have more time to think about the complex part, which is determining what is wrong with the patient and coming up with a treatment plan,” murray says.\\n\\npieces of interactive text called chips serve as links to related cards. as a physician types a note, the autocomplete system recognizes clinical terms, such as medications, lab values, or conditions, and transforms them into chips. each chip is displayed as a word or phrase that has been highlighted in a certain color depending on its category (red for a medical condition, green for a medication, yellow for a procedure, etc.)\\n\\nthrough the use of autocomplete, structured data on the patient’s conditions, symptoms, and medication usage is collected with no additional effort from the physician.\\n\\nsontag says he hopes the advance will “change the paradigm of how to create large-scale health datasets for studying disease progression and assessing the real-world effectiveness of treatments.”\\n\\nin practice\\n\\nafter a year-long iterative design process, the researchers tested medknowts by deploying the software in the emergency department at beth israel deaconess medical center in boston. they worked with an emergency physician and four hospital scribes who enter notes into the electronic health record.\\n\\ndeploying the software in an emergency department, where doctors operate in a high-stress environment, involved a delicate balancing act, agrawal says.\\n\\n“one of the biggest challenges we faced was trying to get people to shift what they currently do. doctors who have used the same system, and done the same dance of clicks so many times, form a sort of muscle memory. whenever you are going to make a change, there is a question of is this worth it? and we definitely found that some features had greater usage than others,” she says.\\n\\nthe covid-19 pandemic complicated the deployment, too. the researchers had been visiting the emergency department to get a sense of the workflow, but were forced to end those visits due to covid-19 and were unable to be in the hospital while the system was being deployed.\\n\\ndespite those initial challenges, medknowts became popular with the scribes over the course of the one-month deployment. they gave the system an average rating of 83.75 (out of 100) for usability.\\n\\nscribes found the autocomplete function especially useful for speeding up their work, according to survey results. also, the color-coded chips helped them quickly scan notes for relevant information.\\n\\nthose initial results are promising, but as the researchers consider the feedback and work on future iterations of medknowts, they plan to proceed with caution.\\n\\n“what we are trying to do here is smooth the pathway for doctors and let them accelerate. there is some risk there. part of the purpose of bureaucracy is to slow things down and make sure all the i’s are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. and if we have a computer dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s for doctors, that may actually be countering the goals of the bureaucracy, which is to force doctors to think twice before they make a decision. we have to be thinking about how to protect doctors and patients from the consequences of making the doctors more efficient,” karger says.\\n\\na longer-term vision\\n\\nthe researchers plan to improve the machine learning algorithms that drive medknowts so the system can more effectively highlight parts of the medical record that are most relevant, agrawal says.\\n\\nthey also want to consider the needs of different medical users. the researchers designed medknowts with an emergency department in mind — a setting where doctors are typically seeing patients for the first time. a primary care physician who knows their patients much better would likely have some different needs.\\n\\nin the longer-term, the researchers envision creating an adaptive system that clinicians can contribute to. for example, perhaps a doctor realizes a certain cardiology term is missing from medknowts and adds that information to a card, which would update the system for all users.\\n\\nthe team is exploring commercialization as an avenue for further deployment.\\n\\n“we want to build tools that let doctors create their own tools. we don’t expect doctors to learn to be programmers, but with the right support they might be able to radically customize whatever medical applications they are using to really suit their own needs and preferences,” karger says.\\n\\nthis research was funded by the mit abdul latif jameel clinic for machine learning in health.\\n\\n\\n'"

interplanetary reach, has been named the new director of the mit media lab, effective july 1, 2021.\\n\\n“leading the legendary media lab is a dream for me, and i can’t wait to help write the next chapter of this uniquely creative, impactful, compassionate community,” newman says. currently she is the apollo program professor of astronautics in mit’s department of aeronautics and astronautics, and a faculty member in the harvard-mit program in health sciences and technology.\\n\\nnewman brings a boldly interdisciplinary perspective to a lab famous for its free-ranging approach to technological innovation. her work has integrated engineering, design, and biomedical research to better understand and facilitate human adaptation to low-gravity environments. her career interests also encompass educational innovation and access, climate change, the performing arts, and science and technology policy.\\n\\nnewman’s unusually broad range of interests combined with disciplinary expertise and talent for invention fit with the media lab’s approach of combining diverse perspectives to build more productive, equitable, and satisfying societies.\\n\\n“i really see the mit media lab as the best place in the world to bring together science, engineering, art, and design, to creatively deal with the huge challenges humanity is facing,” newman says. “the magic of the media lab — which i hope to help build on — is to provide a trusted, open-minded, stimulating space where each person can contribute extraordinary expertise while being stretched beyond their comfort zone to collectively imagine a better, bolder future.”\\n\\nthe selection was announced today in a letter to the school of architecture and planning community from dean hashim sarkis.\\n\\n“in a field of outstanding candidates, professor newman stood out for her pioneering research, wide range of multidisciplinary engagements, and exemplary leadership,” sarkis wrote. “she is a designer, a thinker, a maker, an engineer, an educator, a mentor, a convener, a communicator, a futurist, a humanist and, importantly, an optimist.”\\n\\nthe media lab conducted an extensive worldwide search for a new director, ultimately identifying 60 candidates, 13 of whom interviewed with the search committee.\\n\\n“the irony was not lost on us that the global search culminated in the selection of a member of the mit community,” says pattie maes, professor of media arts and sciences, and chair of the search committee.\\n“but dava emerged as an exceptional and exciting candidate whose interest in how science, design, and technology can intersect in truly novel ways aligns well with the core mission of the lab, as does her infectious optimism, playful, can-do attitude, and fearless approach to big and challenging problems.\\n\\n“i am especially excited about her personal passion for advancing climate research, education and the arts, which are all areas that the media lab hopes to strengthen in the coming years,” add maes, who also chairs the five-member executive committee that has led the media lab since the resignation 15 months ago of former director joi ito.\\nnewman has served as principal investigator on four space missions, developing new experiments and techniques for measuring the dynamics of astronaut activity on the space shuttle, the mir space station, and the international space station. she has developed four advanced suit concepts for intravehicular and extravehicular activity in space and has broken new ground in studying the control of astronaut motion.\\n\\namong her innovations, newman is well-known for developing the biosuit, a 2007 time best invention, which is a supple, “second-skin” space suit that would allow astronauts greater flexibility while providing the pressure needed to function well in a low-gravity environment. first designed — and still intended — for future moon and mars exploration, newman’s biosuit research has generated another potential application, as an assistive device for people with long-term medical challenges.\\n\\nbeyond its technical applications, the aesthetically striking biosuit design has also been exhibited at the venice biennale, the american museum of natural history, london’s victoria and albert museum, chicago’s museum of science and industry, and the metropolitan museum of art.\\n\\nin addition to her distinctive intellectual interests, newman brings a significant leadership portfolio to the director’s position. nominated by president obama, she served as deputy administrator of nasa from 2015 to 2017, the first female engineer in this high-ranking role, and helped to develop the human journey to mars plan. newman also directed mit’s technology and policy program from 2003 to 2015 and has served as director of the mit portugal program from 2011 to 2015, and from 2017 until the present. a longtime advocate for stem education and for women in science and engineering, newman also co-chairs a national academies committee on biological and physical sciences, and serves on a number of for-profit and nonprofit boards.\\n\\nnewman received her bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from the university of notre dame in 1986, a master’s in aerospace engineering from mit in 1989, a master’s in technology and policy from mit in 1989, and a phd in aerospace biomedical engineering from mit in 1992; she was also elected to the mit corporation as the alumni member that year. after a year on the faculty at the university of houston, she joined the mit faculty in 1993, and has been a member of the faculty ever since.\\n\\namong honors from the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics (aiaa), the explorer’s club, and numerous other organizations, newman has been awarded the nasa distinguished service medal and is an aiaa fellow. in 2000, she was named a margaret macvicar faculty fellow, a 10-year mit chair granted for excellence in undergraduate teaching and innovation in education. newman was also head of house from 2005 to 2015 at baker house, an undergraduate residence hall.\\n\\nof newman’s time at nasa, she says it “was an incredible honor to serve and lead, with a portfolio across exploration, science, technology, and innovation. it was also an extraordinary opportunity to work closely with the white house, congress, various governmental agencies, and international partners, all of which provided invaluable lessons in how to balance the nurturing of individual talents and personalities with the development of collective vision and mission to achieve great things on a national and global scale.” newman also stressed the importance of diversity among innovators: “it’s absolutely a highest priority for academia, government, industry, and the arts to make a dramatic sea change. i think of diversity, inclusion, innovation, and expression working together to reach our goals of dynamic equity and radical reinvention.”\\n\\nsince its founding in 1985, the media lab has promoted an interdisciplinary culture to create technologies and experiences that enable people to understand and transform their lives, communities, and environments. it blends a broad research agenda and a graduate degree program in media arts and sciences. the lab has 22 research groups ranging across robotics, smart prostheses, cognitive enhancement, innovative learning, music, and more. lab researchers have developed scratch, a programming language used by around 50 million kids worldwide, as well as influential technology that exposed racial biases in facial recognition systems, and have pioneered research fields such as wearable computing, tangible interfaces, and affective computing. currently the media lab community includes some 400 faculty, researchers, students, and staff.\\n\\nglobally, the media lab’s reach has been extended through more than 100 companies founded by media lab faculty, alumni, and research staff. there are also more than 100 media lab graduates who have gone on to faculty positions at top institutions worldwide.\\n\\n“i plan to start by doing a lot of listening and learning,” newman says. “i like to meet people where they are, and to encourage them to put all their great ideas on the table. i think that’s the best way to go forward, working with the whole community — faculty, students and staff — to tap into everyone’s creativity. i can’t wait to get started. there is so much exciting, important work to do ... together.”\\n\\n\\n'"
